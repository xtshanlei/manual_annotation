"I think this longe has been open no longer than a couple of years....in that time the furniture is broken and tatty (looks like copy stuff from a knock-off factory in China) and the arm is.hanging off this chair I'm typing from. The carpets stained and shabby, lighting not working. ...I also get a sense that the staff are not actually human but possibly robots masquerading as human beings. Just the way they regurgitate their answers to my questions in a detached manner and a false smile is annoying when your tired and don't really...want to be here. Actually I'd say both the Wing and Bridge same comment as I've tried them both tonight. The Bridge also smells like McDonald's. I'm being too kind with two stars maybe.More",I also get a sense that the staff are not actually human but possibly robots masquerading as human beings.,
"Yo soy Mexicano, I love tacos! Tacos here is flavor, so good! I no try other food on menu pero recommendation tacos 100%!,Ordinarily, I wouldn't go to a place like Robo Taco--you have to order your food at a desk, carry a number on a stick to your seat, and then a server will find you.  I prefer to sit down and be served.  Anyhow, I ordered...the huevos rancheros, but they didn't have huevos rancheros sauce.  Jeesh!  So I ordered the giant soft taco.  It was one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten!  I can't stop thinking about it, and I can't wait to go back there and get another one.  The place is small but nice and friendly.More,Portland has a LOT of taco joints, but Robotaco is the most consistently pleasing. I would pick their sauces over anyoneâ__s â__ right balance of spice, salt and flavor â__ the mushroom tacos are outstanding, the nacho chips are yummy fried flour tortilla chips, the...portions are huge, the beans are seriously the best. Plus Bob Ross on the TV (or today: Terror on Dinosaur Island!?! So fun)! I love this place.More,came here at 11:30pm and it was busy. great late night eats. tacos were excellent. had the pork and the fish and both were good.,Small, hole in the wall place to go in this neighborhood for a big plate of rice, beans, and a choice of tacos. Four of us ate and drank for 40.00. Good food at a very good price. Parking can be a challenge if you...arenâ__t willing to pay but street parking is available. We will be back.More,Robo Taco is everything you want in a hole-in-the-wall taco shop. The meats and sides are excellent and the value is solid. I ordered 3 tacos with chorizo, asada, and carnitas. The chorizo and carnitas were great, although the asada was a little chewy. The...rice, beans, and salsa were also really impressive. This is an excellent little lunch spot!More,Funky little with great tacos and open very late. Robo Taco serves up all the standard Tex Mex favourites made fresh with natural meats and tortillas that are handmade daily.
A must do !,Love this place. If you haven't tried it, its worth a trip. Simple street tacos (meat, onion & cilantro) and has a couple veggie options. Funky interior with TVs that often play classic movies or old Bob Ross episodes. I'v tried most of the taco...places in Portland (an obsession of mine) and this is the place I return to often.More,First time I had tacos in Portland while visiting, worth every second. I was told the best tacos around are Robo Taco and they weren't lying. Pretty reasonable prices on tacos, burritos, and beers. Try el pastor, carnitas, and the pollo tacos, you won't be...disappointed.More,Upon landing at Portland airport we stopped for coffee.We asked what restaurants would he recommend.Without hesitation this local said Robo Taco.A funny name but as we discovered great food.The restaurant is a short walk across the sw Morrison bridge and a up and coming industrial...hipster area.We ordered the tacos and a beer.Prices were moderate and well worth the price of the food.
It is a little out of the way but well worth the detour from downtown and the traditional restaurants.You will love this place.More,Loved the asada and caritas tacos!  Sauces are great as is the whole pinto's beans and rice.  Order at the counter and food is brought.  Fresh and tasty, fast and cheap! they offer beer and a few tables outside. Great for a quick bite when...you don't want to spend a lot, it really hit the spot.More,As a non-native, I felt like I might not be in a very safe area of town, and the restaurant was dark, crowded, and seemed dirty.  Our order was not quite right and the food took forever.  But---it was DELICIOUS.  Best nachos I have ever...had.  Worth all the drawbacks to have such great food.More,Quite unremarkable from the outside but super-friendly inside and food to die for at super great value. Robo Taco serves up all the standard Tex Mex favourites made fresh with natural meats and tortillas that are handmade daily. A quirky range of self-service sodas and...a vegan & vegetarian menu, which you'd expect in PDX. You can also have a bevvie in the form of a margarita or Mexican beer. We ate here three times in a four night stay. No-nonsense great grub!More,The place is really tiny but makes some great tacos- and I grew up close to the Mexican border- so I'm a little particular about Mexican food. Order at least 3 for a meal, but that allows you to try different meat combos. I ate...chicken and a friend had the oyster taco- we were both satisfied. You bus your own tables & get your own salsa & water. My office is nearby and staff regularly calls ahead for to go lunches. Consistently yummy.More,This is a small restaurant with great tacos.   I like the chili relleno taco.  This is almost a dive.... but it's hip...  good food, reasonable priced.  Order at the counter...","More,Portland has a LOT of taco joints, but Robotaco is the most consistently pleasing.",
"Out running errands during the holiday season, I was looking something fairly quick for lunch. I've been to this Panera Bread several times through the years and have never been disappointed. So I was happy to stop here again.  Their Broccoli Cheese has always been...a favorite of mine, and this bowl did not disappoint. Paired with an Asian Chicken Salad and a French Baguette, the soup was delicious and filling. The salad was just the right combination of greens, chicken, croutons, and dressing!  The meal certainly hit the spot!! The cashier was friendly; the serving staffer was friendly and even wished me a happy holiday as I picked up my order.More,I said hello and he asked for my order.  I asked him a couple friendly questions and he looked up at me and again asked for my order.  I finally gave up and ordered.  Salad was excellent as well as the sandwich.,Panera Bread is one of my favourite places to eat but they were not on their game this time.  I ordered my usual Turkey Avocado BLT (cold sandwich) and chips and waited 20 MINUTES!  I couldn't believe it.  Will think twice next time on how...badly I want that sandwich.More,I had a bowl of autumn squash soup and it was as good as I remembered. If you are familiar with Panera Bread in other locations, this one feels the same.,My wife and I have a late lunch here once a week. The food is teriffic and the service outstanding. The only drawback is that it is sometimes hard to get a seat during rush hours- that is why we have a ""late lunch."",Its Panera so you know what to expect.  Lots of healthy and flavorful lunch options available.  Also lots of not so health treats here too.,After driving 11 hours my wife and I were looking for a good, fast meal. Panera Bread is usually always a good bet and this one was no exception. Our food was very good and we received it in pretty quick order. By the time...we ordered and paid, it was nearly ready. Good service on their end.More,This is a good location, south of M59 and west of Adams by WalMart.  Place is quiet, has good lite menu items or coffee, depending on the need.  Prices are on par with similar places and walk up service pretty good.,The food is served well, is fresh and tasty and the service very good. Restaurant is clean and menu easy to read and service is good.,If you live in America, then chances are, you've visited a Panera Bread restaurant.  If you haven't yet visited, then you may just have found your new ""go to"" breakfast, lunch, or dinner spot when you are on the road.

Fresh EVERYTHING is really what...it's all about, good coffee and other beverages, great baked goods, made to order sandwiches and salads, hot dishes and my personal favorite, ""you pick two"" - choose a cup of soup and a sandwich, or a sandwich with a salad, the choices are endless, the soups are delicious and they don't disappoint.

Panera Bread is a Bakery and so much more.  This location was staffed with charming staff and our delicious food was ready in minutes to order - eat in or on the go.  Panera Bread really has discovered the recipe for good, fresh food fast.

Try one of their iced seasonal cookies, they are yummy.  Oh and if you need to order online that's super simple too, I did it for an office meeting, everyone got their lunch just the way they ordered it and it was ready for me to collect on time.  I ordered it on Friday for a Monday meeting, so I wouldn't have to worry on a busy Monday.

When we are on the road, we always try to find a Panera Bread, it just sits better when you are travelling.  We love this location, but haven't really found a Panera Bread that wasn't excellent.More", Hi light was the robot which was to collect trays/rubbish,
"This is a lovely underground (literally) pub where all sorts of tasty crafts could be enjoyed. For example the ""Fuvesember"" which is a belgian wheat beer. Please come and spend the most of your money here. They are super friendly and the hospitality level is...top notch! Blessed place.More,Grand Guri Serhaz is a small pub about 450m southeast of Kod_¡ly K_¶r_¶nd offering ten or so craft beers on tap (the selection rotates; the current beers are on a chalkboard above the taps).  I stopped in for supper; the atmosphere was casual, and the...servers were helpful with advice (some English spoken).  I had a large glass of a dark ale (toasted, grainy nose, hints of coffee), which went well with a sandwich and fries. I dined upstairs (there was a flat screen TV showing sports down stairs).  Portions were generous and prices very reasonable.More,This is an excellent place for anyone who loves good quality craft beer. Wide range of selection from lagers, to ipa and stout. In addition very budget friendly prices. It is a bit off the usual tourist track, but it definitely worth the walk,This bar is a hidden gem, of the touristic areas offering wide and ever changing choice of craft beers, IPA-s APA-s but also more simple lagers and fruity beers as well.","Paid the robot as I've been here before and my wife grabbed a Togo box for my sons leftovers from a near by stand. I did enjoy the lunch combo special, since for only $8.00 you get soup or salad, and your entree with fries, so",
"My girlfriend and I visited Choco Facture on a recent holiday to Budapest. We were greeted with a very warm smile and a great explanation of everything that our host made on site. As it was a cold day we decided to each have a...hot chocolate and we were not disappointed. The hot chocolate was thick, creamy and velvety. Absolutely delicious!

We left with a few small chocolates to try later on including one with cayenne pepper, sea salt and caramel, another with mango jelly and some with rum and cherry.

A delightful little chocolate shop well worth a stop by!More,Thank you for your kind words! 
I hope we will meet some time again :),Fantasztikus hely. K_¼l_¶nleges _­zek, isteni k_¡v_©.

Fantastic place, Amazing taste, friendly, warmly Service. Nice coffee. â_¤ï¸_â_¤ï¸_â_¤ï¸_ð___ð__»ð___ð__»ð___ð__»,K_¶sz_¶nj_¼k sz_©pen!,I was looking for coffee and stopped by based on a google review of it â__being the best chocolate in Budapest,â__ and indeed it is! The owner was utterly delightful. He recommended the most delicious chocolate, it was so good I had to sit down...to enjoy it. The coffee was equally delicious, the best Iâ__ve tasted after weeks in Budapest and Turkey. A great stop especially if youâ__ve just gone to the Gellert baths.More,Thank you for your review! Hope we meet someday again :),I was looking for some dark chocolate and also if available some sugar-free chocolate to satisfy an urge I acquired while passing the display window. They had all the items I needed and of course I indulged in the sweet special chocolate treat.,Thank you, for your message :) We hope you'll come again soon.,I had an amazing time at the cute chocolate store in Buda! The chocolates are so tasty and special, they have speciality coffee as well. The stuff was also very nice!! I will go back again for sure to try other sweets... ;),We are waiting for you to come back :),The best experience I have ever had. The staff is friendly, the place is stylish, the chocolate is absolutely delicious. I can especially recommend hot chocolate with chilli powder to warm up in the cold winter time. It was fun to learn how chocolate is...made. Definitely worth visiting this cozy little chocofacture :)More,You can taste it anytime :),Small chocolate manufacturing company with excellent service and tastes. I keep coming back as this place has the best hot chocolate in town. Friendly staff, they answer any question you have about the chocolate you actually eat there. I used to buy there handmade chocolate...as presents to friend and family - everyone loved so far.More,Come and drink hot chocolate again :)", A special aspect of the experience is that a robot named Bella brings you your dinner. Modern bright restaurant with outdoor seating and a iRobot that went up and down the aisle bringing food to each table.,
"I love everything about this subway except for the manager, supervisor male that is always there. Mainly because he always puts the least amount of seafodd and meats on the sandwich. Today I came back to work with a  inch sub, I showed it to...my coworkers and they all said they couldnt even see the tuna. When I ask him to more on, he wants to charge me. Which I am not going to pay extra for something that should be there in the first place. Very disappointed with how he handles that. Almost as if he does it on purpose.More",Loved the robotic waiter.,
"we bought products there for breakfast  and were happy with the selection  -  they have healthy options for some products in case you want less carbs  and so on  -  they offer typical Hungarian bakeries,Good products, average prices, nice place. Unfortunately, despite very pretty shop assistants, they looks always pissed off. It's not pleasant to begin a day facing people like that. (otherwise 4 stars).,This is a staple for the locals. Very good baked goods and a lot of selection, don't be surprised if you have to queue in the mornings as everyone seems to pickup a breakfast on the go or sit in. Very informal but a good...source of a quick bite.More", They got rid of some jobs with a robot hostess.,
"I would travel back in time and survive Pol Pot era Cambodia for Paulâ__s doughnuts. Not only are the Pastries divine, but the owner is a genuinely awesome guy who bears a strong resemblance to David Simon. Not enough likes in the universe For this...place.More,I have loved this place since I was in high school back in the 90's. Nothing you choose is bad, but I love the doughnut holes. I have moved away and still come back for their doughnuts. Better than Krispy Kreme. Better than Dunkin Donuts.,Paul's is a staple in Burlington.  Great cakes and donuts.  Can't go wrong there.  I particularly like the chocolate frosted cream filled donut.,This quaint bakery is a quiet and friendly spot.  I stopped in for the first time just to try something new.  I was pleasantly surprised.  In addition to a ""to die for""doughnut, I tried a slice of cake.  I don't care for buttercream icing, but...the cake was moist and tasty!   I will go back again and try a few more goodies.More,The donuts at Paulâ__s Pastryâ__s are indescribably good. I almost hesitate to call them donuts, as theyâ__re so much more.  From the seasonal fruits (peach is my favorite) to the specials available each visit (caramel with cream and toffee!), every donut looks, tastes and feels...individually handcrafted like a desert in a fancy restaurant.  
Every time I go Iâ__m reminded that your mind simply canâ__t remember how good a pastry/donut can be. This sets the bar. 
Itâ__s a few minutes off Elonâ__s campus and so worth the trip..More,Paul's doughnuts are the best in town. Been around for many years and knows what makes good eating. The are fresh, tasty, and delicious.,Paul's doughnuts are delicious. The aroma is sweet and yes, alluring. The dough has a  yeasty flavor that is so tasty without any icing or frosting. They are soft and moist. Really delicious and not too tremendously sweet or over-glazed. These are nearly perfect, large,...fresh, hand-made doughnuts. 

Paul's offers many other delicious pastries as well, from cinnamon rolls to bear claws to cookies. You can get things to go, or sit and enjoy them with coffee. They also offer various custom-stuffed fillings for your doughnuts that you can choose from, even combine if you please - jellies, cremes, frostings. 

The service is friendly and welcoming. And pricesâ_¦.. surprisingly cheap! Take time out to stop by, you will be glad you did. I don't think we've been by when there wasn't a line. Paul's is a very popular place. These doughnuts can be addictive.More,Love Paul's donuts, but saw the cinnamon twists and they maybe better than the donuts! Will definitely be back soon. May have to get a dozen donuts AND some cinnamon twists.,When they are cooking you can smell them all over town. Their donuts just melt in your mouth. All I ever get is their donuts.,One look, one bite will tell you this place is the real deal.  No machines here...just good quality donuts and pastry.  Very nice young lady behind the counter was very patient with a first time guest.  Got a donut for there and one for later....Both were excellent. They had other pastry and lots of cookies too.  A real gem.More,Take the best birthday cake u have ever tasted.  One with the highest quality butter cream icing.  Like at a $10,000 wedding.  Well.............they take that kind of icing and stuff the  donuts with it.  Nuff said!  well I will add this - theres a 50%...off shelf - where you can rack up a good score without having to worry about them being old and going stale.- because you will eat them in the car in the parking lot.  They will never make it home.  All kind of great treats and cookies and cakes.  I want a job there and I am a grown man with a master's degree!More,Paul's is delicious, cheap and fast! Their doughnut is more ""cakey"" compared to Krispy Kreme. I recommend that everyone try a Paul's doughnut because it's truly the best Graham has to offer.,No kidding, Paul's donuts are to die for.  Far better than those offered by the donut chain operations.,Paul's doughnuts are a must!  We have been enjoying Paul's Pastry Shop for years, and we never tire of it.,I called this fine Bakery/Pastry shop on the recommendation of my daughter, who is a Burlington resident, looking for a small birthday cake for our weekend trip to the city to celebrate my husband's 60th Birthday with our family.  Oh, am I ever glad that...I did!!  For a mere $10, I was able to purchase, by phone, a scrumptous 6"" chocolate on chocolate birthday cake which was so delicious that there are no words to describe it's wonderful texture & taste!!  I also ordered some doughnuts and muffins for Sunday morning breakfast and both were simply the best I have ever tasted.  The folks at Paul's were ever so kind and helpful when I called them on Thursday for a Saturday am pick up order and made my purchase by VISA so easy for ordering and pick up.  I have never been so impressed by a bakery!!  I am a lifetime resident of the home of the famous Dewey's Bakery and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts...and neither has anything on Paul's Pastry Shop, believe me!!  I will be using Paul's for every birthday, special occassion, and just as a great place to stop in for donuts, muffins & coffee on all of my trips to visit my daughter and granddaughter in Burlington...And...I shall never make a ""Tanger Run"" without a stop by Paul's for ""goodies"" to bring home!!  Great cakes & pastries and wonderful, friendly service!!  Thanks, Pauls!!More",None,
"I am so TERRIBLY dissatisfied, disappointed and aggravated and yep Iâ__m not exaggerating.

We decided to pass by food court and buy food in KFC. We used the self kiosk (self service ) for efficiency and convenience then we went to the waiting area for...our order. There was one employee who was saying the numbers loudly and giving orders to the customers

We waited patiently UNTIL ITâ__S MORE THAN 30 MINS AND OUR NUMBER WAS SKIPPED :) Take note I am a patient person when it comes with waiting time and I understand how itâ__s hard to work in a fast food service + you can check my reviews here in google and I never reviewed a 1 star until I experienced this sh1t customer service

THE GUY/EMPLOYEE just ignored us after getting our receipt when I followed up because we are already waiting for more than 20 mins and our number is 70 and itâ__s already 94. Then my bf was getting mad because itâ__s now 30mins and he asked for a refund BUT THIS EMPLOYEE WAS RUDE AND BRUSHED IT OFF / IGNORED WHAT HE SAID.

I followed up again and took another 15-20 mins. We FINALLY got our order and we went to the cinema so we really didnâ__t CHECK OUR ORDER until we got seated

BUT GUESS WHAT?? THE ORDER IS INCOMPLETE OR INSHORT, MISSING ITEM. Followed up multiple times, rude employee and STILL MISSING ITEM.

I literally am seated in the cinema atm and am so angered that I immediately wrote this review real time

AND I will edit this after I went back to KFC and get the RUDE EMPLOYEEâ__s NAMEMore,Delicious food. Staff was incredibly helpful and service was very great . Overall we had an great experience.,I never complain about food, sometimes itâ__s cold sometimes the Strips are too small but itâ__s fine not the end of the worldâ_¦ but being treated in a bad way, from some staff, not friendly, not professional in Festival mall is the worst thing ever!...They are so rude and donâ__t have the minimum qualities to deal with people.More,Around 11:45pm, I went to kfc in AL kahel get to order  kfc diner meal and I was have the number 78 but when I meet the supervisor to tell him about my order he toll me to wait and after 20 mnt I toll...him about and he said the order has been cancel and I ask him why it's has been cancel and said only cancel so after discution the manager came and when I want to explain to him, he said to me to chatap.
Thank you for you taking this complete as seriousMore,Staff couldn't care less. Unorganised a lot of people working but not achieving much. Long wait, most orders muddled up. People were asking for straws etc. Hi light was the robot which was to collect trays/rubbish well it wandered around good idea but started dropping...some of the rubbish. Good entertainment. Needed to be emptied a bit more often. Poor customer service.More,unhealthy disgusting and they do not clean the fryer or change the oil. all the chicken is battery farmed and fed junk.ð_¤¢ð_¤¢ð_¤®ð_¤®,Worst ever service never again. I placed an order at 10:30 it never came. 1 am my child slept without eating. Terrible terrible never try unless you want your family to sleep hungry,We walked into KFC Circle mall at 11pm and were told that the fries were not available. No other option was given except coleslaw irregardless of my lactos intolerance. The staff Regyn and Rachel the supervisor were unhelpful and started talking in a different language...than English infront of us. This is disappointing as we are loyal customers since our home country :-(More,The guy name kumar is really rude really rude and he's not professional and the chicken is really cold,the service leaves something to be desired, they don't drink without sugar, they threw me 2 plastic glasses and a bottle of pepsi.
bad experience,Teribble service,  the service was very bad even the kfc strips was very salty, . When we complain about that the staff told us that it is always very salty . Which was not informed us in the beginning and when we complain they start...arguing with us. Not expected with the kfc like this. The kfc in jlt is really disasters. They ruined our Christmas party ð__¬ð__¬More,We went to KFC at lower ground level in Dubai Mall, service is terribly slow and disappointing, our food  was too cold and the spicy chicken was not spicy. In addition to that, it is so sad that the asians working in KFC are being...racist just because iam also an asian.More,The restaurant was open, people queueing up to order (some just walked out again) and the patrons were happily bring ignored by the staff counting money and getting their day started. 
10 min wait to order, another 15 minutes for food delivery. People on a...lunch break would have to eat while running ð___â__â__ï¸_ back to the office. 
Off course the food is KFC quality but look at the reviews and decide if you should not rather go somewhere else!More,The order was messed up. I called to complain. They were rude on telephone. This KFC should fire manager.,Worst service from kfc online.My order had fries missing yet the food comes with fries, the staff very poor there isn't any customers service even if your regular client. Your order chances online and comes different the guys delivering can't even communicate properly in English...just wonder who hires them. Rather buy direct money just Flys away and you can't even contact them. KFC IS THE WORST ONLINE ORDRING BEWARE.More",Someone told us about this robot and we wanted to check it out.,
"Came in with the family for dinner. Waited 15 mins to be sat which was no problem. I assumed they were short staffed due to plenty of available tables. The food was good, just took surprisingly long for chicken tenders and margarita chicken. Our server wasn't really there and didn't really check in with us at all....Paid the robot as I've been here before and my wife grabbed a Togo box for my sons leftovers from a near by stand. We don't go here too much but may stick with other restaurants near by.More,Why the restaurants think this will help their bottom line, I don't know. I for one had to ask my waitress Jill a zillion questions and then she ended up doing most of the work, thank God she had patience with this old lady!!! I...know I am old fashioned, but I still like to be waited on exclusively by PEOPLE, who take care of my order, and the payment as well. I did enjoy the lunch combo special, since for only $8.00 you get soup or salad, and your entree with fries, so that was indeed a good deal, but does NOT take away from the robotic atmosphere, I probably will NOT be returning here.More", It even have a robot that serves your food sometimes.,
"first time food took 1 hour and tables floors filthy. bad service bad food. not like old Bob Evans we all knew and loved. management seems detached angry and iritable doesn't care when politely professionally told. Wait staff admitted they get non stop complaints about...food. Went back again and the exact same thing happened we walked out before ordering after bein seated a table w ketsup all over it. poor greeting upon entry zero acknowledgement and i said HI to manager she rolled her eyesMore,HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS ARE THERE TO SAY TERRIBLE?
My wife and I ordered 2 Turkey and Dressing Dinner Bell Plates for curbside pickup. I had tried this a few months ago and it was OK, for the price. Last night, not so much. This...was perhaps the worst restaurant food I've ever experienced!

We arrived right at the scheduled pickup time and the order was ready. But for how long had it been sitting, because less than 15 minutes later when we were eating it, it was barely lukewarm. 

The meal includes sliced turkey, dressing, and mashed potatoes. The potatoes had, at the very most, a teaspoon of gravy on top. And that was the end of the gravy. None on the dressing or turkey. Needless to say, what could have been acceptable dressing was REALLY dry! [How much does gravy cost? lol] And the turkey: just a couple of VERY small slices [just a few bites] that must have been leftover from Thanksgiving. It was very dry, tasteless, and as tough as shoe leather. If we'd eaten at the restaurant, these meals would have gone back! No way I would have paid for this crap.

I""m not sure I'll ever try Bob Evans again for dinner or lunch. Their breakfasts are usually pretty decent for the price.More,Judy was my server, friendly, prompt, I had the Oatmeal, Strawberry and Banana with banana bread, everything was very good. I come back weekly. Place is run very professionally as well and servers are very attentive.,Breakfast  over price and not hot  would not waste my time toast was hard cold and eggs with cheese was cold,Kayla was my server, awesome as always, had the biscuits and gravy also a side of bacon everything was very good definitely will be back again,After being seated, waited nearly ten minutes for a server to acknowledge us.  Server seemed to be aggravated about  ""who knows what"" and took our order in an abrupt manner.  (She even returned two times to confirm what we had ordered).   Food came out and...tasted good.  Same server never returned until she dropped a check on our table and disappeared again.   She made our experience not so good.More,360 degree turnaround from the last time we ate there.  Good service, clean tables, clean bathrooms, ample portions.  Everything was just right.  Will return again in the near future.,First time here ...! With 4 tables to serve on a saturday evening we arrived at 8:15 and got our order finaly by 9:25 ....  ! With just one server running around carzy...! She kept apologizing for the long wait...! Finaly our order of turkey...sandwitch arrived with side of fries n brocolie ...! The fries were hard ...! Sandwitch was supposed to be tosted as per our order but was sloppy with letteus , tomatoes , onion stuffed with turkey brest i could make a better one at home...! I wonder if it takes an hour to make that...! The other dish was fired chicken breast served with mashed potatoes which was dry with a spoon full of gravy...! We were soo disspointed we left the food half way and left. Their online menu says diffrent stuff than whats actaly served...! Extremely disspointed.More,Bob Evans is a restaurant that is grounded in the basics and just keeps getting better!    I took friends who had not been there for a very long time and all six of us were impressed with good food!  I had the country fried steak...with mashed potatoes, gravy and green beans but letâ__s not forget the warm delicious biscuits!  The service was good and very friendly and prompt!  There are lots of good restaurants but donâ__t forget some of your old favorites!More,After a day of sightseeing we spotted Bob Evans and decided that was Lunch. Living on the East coast we donâ__t see this chain but have heard good things and after two
Bad experiences at independent restaurants in Fort Myers I needed consistency and got...it here! Clean,efficient and tasty meal at a good price.More,I've been a regular customer at this Bob Evans location for many years.  But there is an ongoing problem that has occured during the past several weeks.  Food orders are either extremely slow in reaching the customers,or the order is prepared wrong by someone in...the kitchen.  The on-duty management (two or more Ass't Managers always visible) are not on top of all the existing problems.  I've witnessed many customers verbally complain to the managers on duty, and only a verbal apology is issued.  By the time the complaint is made, he/she does not need a discount on their bill as the Ass't Managers so frequently offer.  
Managers job is to ensure that the entire food service operation runs efficiently and smoothly.  Unfortunately this has not been the case.  The Ass't Managers run the cash registers, and sometimes bus tables.  But they do not check on the timeliness of the food coming from the kitchen, nor do they spotcheck some of the kitchen orders to see if they are prepared correctly.  
So until this place gets some management in place that cares, it will continue to go downhill.  (and that's putting it nicely).More,Such large portions and delicious food.  Even gave us a large piece of pie as part of the meal.  Turkey and mashed potatoes, veggies, rolls with butter, ham, cranberries, and the pie....all great and more than we expected.  Servers were quick and food came out...fast.More,They have the best Biscuits & Sausage Gravy of anywhere.
Biscuits were fresh. Gravy was nice and thick, and loaded with sausage.
Only problem with this restaurant, as with most,,they keep it too cold!!!!
Makes you feel like you have to eat warm food quickly,...to eat it while it's still warm!!More,Food really good!  I think they were short staffed,  but the server Dave did great!   We appreciate seeing people work as a team to give good service,  as well. 

My boyfriend LOVES their sausage gravy.   He goes to Bob Evans anytime he's in a town...with one.More,One of two locations in Ft Myers has continued to be a mainstay for breakfast or low priced dinner special ($7.990) each night. Or just when you are craving a really good pancakes. Staff is professional and friendly. Parking is a problem (shares lot with...Costco) and entering from highway 41 almost impossible.

"Best pizza I ever had. I am a amateur  pizza chef myself and this was quite an experience. Very nice staff and service. The winw was served at the right temperature as well. I will be back,D_¥ligt bem_¶tande

I had booked a table and they gave me a place by the toilet although all the tables were empty.
So I was disappointed and left the place.,We booked a table but they wanted to place us in the tight corridor and when we asked for another place the offered us a table by the toilet or at the entrance! We did not stay and left the place! Their answer was that...they offered us 3 places and we did not accept to stay!!! I do not know who enjoys to sit at a tight place or by the toilet specially when they have booked already?! I have seen in the other reviews that people were not satisfied of the service but we tried anyway and now understand why!More,Quality food made with genuine ingredients. The best pizza in the world. Simply amazing! Great service and cozy restaurant.,Honestly one of the best pizzas Iâ__ve eaten since moving to Sweden from California in 2005. Had to wait in line a few minutes but worth the wait. We were in the area for a little mini vacation and after viewing some of the shows...from godare ( tv food channel) we hit up a couple of restaurants and mastio was one that we planned on visiting. Fresh ingredients and the crust was awesome.Everyone has their perception on what entails a good pizza. I know I have a few friends that would prefer a pizza plastered with processed cheese kebab and French fries or processed ham.. If you love the taste of those kind of pizzas youâ__re probably not going to really appreciate the flavors of Italian pizzas here. We have our favorite pizzabagaren in our neighborhood too but just doesnâ__t compare.More,Over all, fantastic food. Pizza made ""the real italian way"", filled with flavors and delicious dough. Pizzas are a bit pricy though, despite their great ingedients. We received fast and friendly service, and we were lucky to  sit outside in a nice evening weather.

What...brings the experience down is the rediculously pricy drinks. â_¬ 13 for a small glass of red wine. â_¬ 9 for a 0.3l bottle of local beer. It's a shame really.More,Great pizza with fantastic dough. Selection is a bit limited (to three variants in total) and no flexibility on adding or making changes on the menu (you simply like it or not which can be frustrating if you prefer customization!). Interior is cozy and the...outdoor area is better. Go there on a warm day/evening and sit outside.More,I heard a lot about Mastio and I was looking forward to it. I knew it wan not an italian pizza regarding the condiment, but I was openminded, as long as the dough was good. 
The location is really nice, the place is furnished with...taste and the people working there all very nice and polite. We had two take away Maggan. 
But....despite the good quality of the ingredients and the good â__lookâ__ of the pizza, I was disappointed by the actual taste. The dough could be good if not for the fact that it was too â__doughyâ__ like if it was not properly cooked. Probably too much oil in the dough and some unbalance in the baking. 
The tomato sauce was way too cooked for pizza, and was overtaking the all balance. 
Maybe if you take a pizza without tomato and you eat it right away you will be more satisfied than me (and my 6 years old son who actually left half of the pizza).
Even without thinking that it was a pizza, whatever was the dish, it was disappointing, which is a pity because I saw there was love in making it. Try again, itâ__s just not right...yet.More,We were there on 7/7 at 16.30. The restaurant was half empty as we wanted to go early to avoid the crowd. I counted 9 staff for a medium sized restaurant with no apparent leader. Hence staff took turn to eat at the end of...the bar and 2-3 other staff joined their eating colleague in a conversation about summer etc. Very little eye contact with guests hence signalling that we were not important. Ms Mastio may have won the Master Chef competition but has forgotten the importance of good service. Would have been a perfect experience if a manager would have worked the floor and stopped the chatting among the service personnel. Otherwise a nice venue but hardly a place I would return to.More,Pizza with only top quality ingredients cooked to perfection. The selection is always small but super tasty. Staff is professional and service is kind and quick.,Love the location of Mastio, the atmosphere and of course the pizza.  The seating outside on sunny days canâ__t be beaten.,Staff with plenty of attitude but zero service orientation. This is an overpriced pizza joint (only 3 choices on the menu when we visited) but with the undeserved snobbery of a multiple Michelin star restaurant.,The service was absolutely great, nice pizzaâ__s, dessert and drinks. We really loved the place and the nice people who are working there!,I really like the place and the atmosphere and I was told that the pizzas were to die for but I can't say I agree, and they are definitely overpriced. Service is great and I must try some other food than the pizzas as I...like the place, great location and very very cozy.More,Pizza fantastic- best place in MALM__ for a non-traditional tasty pizza with style! Family friendly and in summer a lovely terrace. Nothing else just pizza.", The robots have taken over.,
"Very fast and efficient service. The galette were really good, with a lot of posibilities to choose from. The menus in the tablets were really useful to navigate all the possible choices,This restaurant has outside seating on the port but it was too cold so we went indoors. Inside, it looks more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. They serve a bit of everything from crepes, to burgers, seafood, steaks. You select your food on a...tablet which is a bit slow. The waiter did not check our order once we were done with the tablet. This resulted in a mistake, apparently we ordered two set menus with desert instead of one. Food was ok.More,We had lunch in here on our last day before we were driving to Paris. 
The staff was nice, the food we ordered was excellent. We were sitting on the other side of the street at the harbor.,Very nice place, lovely food, everything was delicious, the service was fast and friendly, they even spoke English. We enjoyed our lunch.,We had a lovely lunch there today. The food is really nice and the service was great. We were not rushed to eat even though it was quite busy. We chose this restaurant out of many around, and we were not dissapointed.,We came here with a group of ten and we got a separate dining room (perfect in this COVID time). You choose your food with a tablet and the food is very good for a 3 course menu for â_¬ 15,90 or â_¬ 18,90. Drinks...however are quite expensive. Good location near the harbour.More,Weird order of bringing drinks, food, sauce, ... Quite friendly service. Mussels were good (well priced too). Dessert was molten. Coffee was late and wrong size.,This was our first meal in France and what a bad way to start off our vacation.  We chose this place mostly because it was one of the few places that was open.  Many places are closed for the season starting in Sept. so the...number of restaurants was limited.

The menu was on an electronic tablet and selection is made on this tablet.  We opted for the ""formula"" meal which is a popular way to eat in France - it includes 3 courses selected from a items for each course.

The starters were melted goat cheese on baguette and pink shrimp.  These were OK.  Entrees were skate fish and something called ""farmer"" with mushrooms and cheese.  The skate fish was filled with cartilage ""bones"" and was nearly inedible due to the overwhelming amount of this cartilage.  The ""farmer"" was inedible.  It tasted what I imagine dog food tastes like.  I could barely eat a few bites.  At least the dessert was chocolate.
We laughed about it later but it was a bad experience.  We named the restaurant ""Cafe du Bow-Wow"".  
I do not recommend this place.More,Stayed in Fecamp and had a lunch and dinner here during the week. We were a group of grandparents and two grandkids aged 9 and 7. The kids liked the tablets with pictures of the food and they helped them to choose. The food was...of good quality and well presented. Apparently the chicken nuggets on the kids menu which look like fish fingers were the best our granddaughter had ever eaten and sheâ__s a fussy 7 year old. The piece of beef was tender and cooked well done as requested. The desserts are the simple highlight. The service from a young team was attentive and helpful. Altogether a pleasant and unfussy place and reasonable value for money with a nice harbour view.More,Sadly this was the stand out really awful restaurant in our entire trip. Food was diabolical. I had moules frites. The mussels were overcooked to the point of rubber, the mariniere sauce looked like dirty washing up water and tasted worse. Dreadful. I ordered a...mojito as an aperitif - it was fine, but arrived in a large, unwieldy, grubby wooden 'thing' - this should have been a sign of what was to come... starter of goat's cheese salad - cold, soggy on a few pre-bagged salad leaves. My husband's burger was inedible and tasted off. He left it. We couldn't get out of there quick enough. Staff didn't speak English or French - I tried to speak to one in both languages and she said she had no time to speak and stalked off. The younger people serving were working hard and trying their best. They have a system whereby you order food via a tablet in your own language and it converts it to their own language, consequently interaction was minimal to zero.More,The view is one of the best things about this place. In combination with the seafood, itâ__s a great spot to visit! You can order the food with a tablet in your own language. The staff will read the tablet in their own language, that's...the way they take your order.More,The restaurant has a seafront location and seems to be popular with young people in Fecamp. The menu is displayed on a tablet by which you also make your order. The interface is not quite intuitive as many options show only after your first choice....But we got our dinner. 
The dishes were very standard, my beef challenged my chewing capacity. The best part of the set menus was the dessert, absolutely delicious.
Service was fluent and youthful.More,You will get value for your money, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. Used the special offer with starter, main and dessert, of each of them there was a variety of choice.,Welcome place to escape the elements of weather and still be aprt of the town and outside.
Table with a view was cosy and enjoyable.
Water was brought  to table upon arrival.

Tablets were given to avoid problems with language. Many language options were available....This saved misunderstandings in Provincial France.

Most helpful, efficient staff were happy at all times to serve and please.

Great variety of options for Formulae et Plats de Jour.
We chose prawns and herrings for Entrees. Both were delightful and pleasant to taste. Towellettes provided for finger cleansing after prawn peeling. Most interesting dressing for prawns. Side salad sufficient.
Basket of bread accompanied each of entree and mains.

One chose turkey scallop,  the other chose beef for mains. Both were good. Pleasant accompanying sauces complemented the meat. Bowl of crisp potato chips frites  - accompanied mains. Great!

Both chose limon crepes, sucre was appreciated as an extra with serving.
Small cup of coffee, expresso, was a delightful finish to a most flavoursome and healthy lunch.More,Having walked along the front and down to the port we were well ready for lunch. The food is simple and demotic but very well presented and of very good quality. It really hit the spot and we left feeling well contented for a somewhat...slower return along the prom to the car.More", The robots have taken over.,
"I have never been treated so rudely!   We arrived in the beautiful gardens and the lady in charge offered us a table and then as we about to sit down she abruptly withdrew the offer and told us the kitchen was closed with no explanation!...Shocking customer service!  I have never experienced this kind of treatment before.  Very unfriendly and unwelcoming!More,We enjoyed one evening at Gino e Gaby and we LOVED it! Dinner was so good we wanted to come again but were not lucky with a reservation. However this one evening totally made it for us and we would recommend to everyone to eat...here. Also as a plus to the quality of the food, the staff is extremely friendly and let you stay as long as you want.More,We ate fish, meat and seafood. The food was very tasty with grilled vegetables. The atmosphere in the restaurant was friendly and cozy. Service was fast and the price reasonable. Gluten-free food was great. Good wine.,The food was well prepared and in harmony with the lovely surroundings and the wine selection topped the experience together with the attentive service.

2 memorable dinners,Very deceiving restaurant...compared to the attrative garden outside...The blond lady who received us boarderline...I would never go back nor reccomend this place...very unpleasant rigid ambiance, she only smiles while she gets the bill payment.,We ate here twice during our week in Cannero, and enjoyed excellent food both times in pretty garden surroundings, without breaking the bank. We tried several of the most highly-rated restaurants in Cannero, and considered this the best of all those we tried - and...well worth the walk up from the waterfront.More,A warm welcome and a good menu. Delicious food - goat cheese salad, salmon in herb crust, braesola, linguine with sea food. Beautiful setting amongst the roses. Good value compared to rest of Cannero.,My wife and I enjoyed Gino e Gaby so much that we dined there (June 2019) six times in a ten-day stay. Though not far from the lakeside, the restaurant doesnâ__t have a lake view, but offers a spacious seating area in an attractive garden...where oranges, lemons, and grapefruits grow and sparrows keep themselves busy.
 
We found the service to be friendly, attentive, and efficient. It was also generous: on an evening when I was so hungry as to wonder whether the dish of ravioli I was ordering might be insufficient, the proprietress offered (I hope with no regrets) to adjust the portion size to whatever I needed. 

The suppliers of the ingredients are named on the menu â__ usually a good sign. So it proved. Weâ__re fussy eaters but were never disappointed, enjoying all our meals. Everything _¬we ate â__ vegetables, fish, meat â__ was cooked accurately. Presentation was attractive without being unnecessarily elaborate, and we looked forward to our meals at Gino e Gaby with eagerness. The range and quality of dishes meant that even after six visits we were not wishing for a different menu. With three courses each and a 50cl carafe of wine (but no coffee) our average evening bill came to just under â_¬80.  

Cannero is an attractive resort, compact and well-placed for Lake Maggioreâ__s ferry service, for buses, and for strenuous walks. Gino e Gaby complemented it beautifully. Be warned though: it opened at 6.30pm; and many outside tables would be taken by 7pm.More,This is a nice restaurant where they serve fresh food well cooked, nothing fancy.
The terrace is big and nice,This is a very meticulous restaurant, everything is done well. I went there twice in three days. Exquisite food, fantastic service, lovely ambiance and very good value, if you are not delighted then you should have not come to Italy? Make sure you book.,We went there as TA rate was high - unfortunately food-wise we were moderately happy as food (fish, beef) was made properly but we felt like on German soil and not in Italy. On both plates potatoes and some boiled vegetables. On bright side: the...place has wanderful garden, service is very nice and fast, prices are affordableMore,This is a restaurant in a lovely setting however when we get our meal the pork was uncooked. I took this to the waiter who was lovely and apologised straight away. Another one was cooked however my friend had finished her meal by the time...my meal arrived. When I complained asking for a free desert the owner agreed but was very rude - laughing with the other staff. Her reply was â__the second one was perfectâ__ I would argue the first one should be perfect for 16 euros!  
Would NOT eat here again which is a shame as it is a lovely garden but very overpriced for bland food.More,Lovely atmosphere and quite good food but unfriendly staff which tends to ruin the experience. Restaurant has a lovely garden and is close to centre of Cannero. There are other options in this quaint town.,Food was very good, wine reasonable and puddings excellent.
But staff a little stuffy.
However, overall a good experience.,We came to eat with a reservation for 6:30, opening time, 4 adults, 2 kids. We were treated nicely by the Italian staff, however very rudely by the blond, tall lady who took our order who appears to be the owner or boss. She was...extremely unfriendly seeing that we had two children with us. She kept grunting and rolling her eyes as if she didn't understand when we tried to ask if they could make a simple penne pasta with a cream sauce for our 2-yr old in both German and in English with attempts in broken Italian. We would have thought it was just the way she is, but 5 minutes later a German couple was seated next to us and she came full of smiles and spoke perfect German to them...not nice to be treated so differently and act like she couldn't understand German when she spoke it as a mother tongue! Food was very nice though!More", The robot delivers  your food.,
"we were very regular customers (twice a week) When we asked to sit at a particular table of which four were empty just like it the manager refused to sit us there. We reminded her (as she knew) that we were very good customers. Her...reply was everyone is a gpood customer and if you don't like it you can leaveMore,My husband and I had dinner here with two other couples. We were all happy with our dinners. A special aspect of the experience is that a robot named Bella brings you your dinner.,Busy on a weekday night. Two couples seated outside with a reservation promptly.
Servers are efficient and attentive. Wife had Tom Yum soup with shrimp then a Spider Roll. I had Korean Noodle Bowl and Wonton soup. Food tasty, portions good, reasonable prices for the...quality of food eaten. Will be back.More,We made reservations a few weeks ago and the Sea was packed. Modern bright restaurant with outdoor seating and a iRobot that went up and down the aisle bringing food to each table.  The servers were friendly and efficient as well.  

The menu was extensive...and everything looked delicious. We started with a glass of yuzu Served in a champagne glass, it was delicious. My husband and I started by sharing the sushi sampler. The sushi was fresh delicious and like butter.  We then shared in entr_©e of crispy duck with a sweet ginger sauce. The half a duck was well prepared with brown rice and bokchoy .  Friends enjoyed their wonton soup, duck salad &.scallops.More,We live nearby and decided to try The Sea mostly because it was close by and we didnâ__t want to travel far. We shared a sushi roll to start and then had stir fry..The food was very good and fresh- the stir fry had better...and fresher vegetables than many other restaurants. A little bit pricey.More,Found this gem a few years ago when my daughter and I landed and were starving.  As usual she wanted Asian and it came up by chance that we were close by.  Place was packed but they allowed us to grab seats at the sushi...bar.  Watched in amazement as dishes came out, one after the other looking amazing.   We returned last night and as always it did not let us down.  Tom Ka with chicken is out of this world.  Best Pad Tai ever.  Servers are all friendly and serving as a team is always efficient so food temperature and flavor.  Masaman lamb shank is crazy good by the way.More,One of our favorites. Fantastic Poke bowls, Bailey buns, Pad Thai. The tempura string beans and steamed dumplings are addicting.,We have been dining at the SEA since it opened but last night we noticed several subtle differences. The restaurant looked the same right down to the menus. However, the staff was unfamiliar and the quality of the food was definitely off. Is this a...figment of our imagination or has the restaurant undergone a change in ownership and management? The restaurant was certainly crowded but the usual excellent dining experience was lacking.More,Heard that this place is owned by the same folks who own the Lemongrass chain. Itâ__s OK but costs a bit more than Lemongrass,Consistently good food with great service. The past few times we have chosen to eat outdoors. During the New Years rush they added several more tables outside. It did not affect the service or the food.
We do not do sushi but the fusion food...and the appetizers are great!More,Food and service were good. We were seated close to our reservation time. The indoor waiting area is very crowded, so we waited for about 10 minutes outside.  When we followed the waitress to our table, it had not been set and we stood in...an aisle and waited.
Each time our server came and asked us for various orders she left so quickly we did not have a chance for questions.
The food was good not great. The lobster was a little overdone. The noodle dishes were quite good. Prices were reasonable.More,First time visit after the morikami gardens.  We had the sweetest waitress who really seemed to want to make us happy.  All the dishes were great.  Lobster monster roll, gyoza, chicken sate, shrimp tempura were all perfect. I have a food allergy and the waitress...was careful to keep me safe. Full bar with interesting drink choices.  My only criticism was the music. Should play something Japanese or islandMore,This was our first visit to The Sea Asian Kitchen, entertaining a new employee and his wife; but a casual, fun dinner. I read the reviews online and was very excited to go.  The highlights of the night - great company, outstanding food, and really...good cocktails! We ordered several appetizers, such as sushi rolls, spicy beef salad, pork gyoza, and lobster shrimp shumai. Each item was better than the other...so we had to order more to be sure! The ramen was excellent too!  The only thing that was surprising to me when we walked in was the noise level and cramped spaces, but it was fine. It is not a young crowd, so if you are looking for something trendy & hip, you may not enjoy the atmosphere. We considered leaving, but we are so happy we stayed - the food is THAT incredible. Also, we are not sure what the ""official"" name is. The sign says THE SEA, the website says the theseaasianbistro and other internet searches show the Sea South East Asian Kitchen.More,Food, Service, space, and menu was perfect. We now have a new favorite when we come down for the winters.,The Sea is a regular favorite of ours for fusion Asian cuisine, good service, and reasonable prices. My wife and I like to share a couple of Thai dishes after bowls of soup. In past visits we have also enjoyed the sushi.","It's also a modern restaurant where you can find a nice robot helping the waiters with the orders. Additional points to the robot cat waiter, which brings the food to the tables.",
"We stopped in for ice cream as it was a place we used to visit many years ago.
The ice cream was okay...,They have really good ice cream and plenty of choices with interesting names such as Meewasin mud, tin roof, strawberry rhubarb pie, etc.   We went on a rainy night and it was still pretty crowded.  There are good size inside and outside seating areas.,Allen Malberg-Owner

So sad that this business has become one of the worse places in Saskatoon to take your family too, due to the rudeness of the management and how they treat their customer and staff. Is it because the previous owners developed such a...great reputation and known for their outstanding customer service and amazing treatment of their staff that Allen Malberg took this for granted.More,The best ice cream location in Saskatoon. Perfect on a hot summer day and itâ__s outside quiet backyard sitting make you want to return. The best old fashioned setting for ice cream and milkshakes. But may get busy during lunch time on summer and holiday...celebration days with the line stretching all the way outside tâ__identifias the street, but itâ__s worth the wait.More,Someone in the Homestead Ice Cream lab has a donut fixation this summer. For anyone who loves the donut, there are some amazing flavours to choose from. Might require more than one visit. Fun times for all ages!,I am sad to write this review. We have been going for many, many years. Over the years the portions have gotten smaller, the quality poorer and the price higher. Friday will be our last visit. Two scoops of ice cream that was so small...it wouldn't have been enough for a child and the taste was bland at best. The guy serving us seemed like he was put out to actually have to help us too. Disappointing.More,Staff were friendly and quick, the atmosphere is fun and they have a great selection, love that the banana split had 3 flavors of icecream plus the toppings,Love Homestead! The flavours, friendly staff and the atmosphere. I have noticed though that the last few visits that we were there, that they are way understaffed! We were there last night around 6:45-7 and there was only one young lady working and the line...up was to the door! She was so apologetic and was doing her best but a few finally walked out the door. Great place but one or two more staff would have been helpful, not just for the line to keep moving but for the hard working girl scooping up the ð__¦More,After reading reviews that this was the best place for ice cream in the city, we had high expectations.  Maybe that is why we were so disappointed.  The taste of the ice cream was average, nothing special.  The portion sizes were relatively small and perhaps...the most disappointing from a specialty ice cream shop was the cone itself.  Unless you opt for the waffle cone and pay the extra, you get a bland cheap cone.  Although there were lots of interesting flavours, it wasn't enough to get us to come back.More,My family and I ordered double cones that were very small and had no ice cream in the actual cone, just perched on top. The staff was rude when we questioned the small amount of ice cream and we were responded to with eye rolls...and snarky comments. My mom later found a hair in the cone and complained to the manager. The manager was ruder than his employees and said, â__the costumer is not always right.â__ Spend your money elsewhere!More,Love the unique flavors that are always changing! Small little patio outside is great for sitting down to enjoy your treat. Huge downfall in my opinion is how crazy busy it gets, I have almost never waited less than 15-20 minutes.,I thought it was good ice cream! Just confused on how it all work wish there was more information, especially on the soft serve flavours!,Noticed a total decline in quality this year. I had a large sunday with caramel... there must be a notice from management to skimp on the toppings cause there was next to none on the ice cream. GF had the frozen yogurt which she ended...up throwing in the garbage. I used to reall like this place and went 15 times last year. Wont be back any time soon. Save yourself the disapointment and just got to dairy queen.More,Went for ice cream and blizzards/- theyâ__re not called blizzards there but you know what I mean.  The blizzards are the best in town and the cones are good to.  Worth the stop and my opinion best place for ice cream in Saskatoon,A lot of choices and flavours, and even for those with dietary issues. The style of the place was cute - retro diner - and the outside patio was wonderful on a nice night.", Cat Robot Waiters serving the patrons.,

Definitely an awesome evening... and excellent service.. â_ºï¸_will surely come back!,Cavalli Club is truly a unique place. It has a lot of glam and has an elite feel to it. Great ambience and good music. The food was delicious and service was on point. It was also an evening filled with entertaining performances  of dance...acts and live singing. Definitely worth the visit and we had a really great time!More,We had an amazing night watching world class show while having mouth watering foods and drinks. Love this place!,We went to Cavalli with friends and had Booked a table.
The service was quick , the music was pumping and performances added to the glamour.
Overall a great night out.
The after party at anonymous ensured the party kept going.,Its very good place for food
I loke it v much  food was excellent team was also good. Management was good,Intresting performances along delicious food.
unqiue dinner experience.
Recommended for unqie food lovers,From the red carpet entrance, friendly and accommodating staff, elegant and cozy vibe, mouth-watering food, great selection of drinks, fabulous and jaw-dropping shows/entertainment and great value for money...what more can i ask for?,Had such a lovely time at @cavalliclubdxb ð_¥° a very 90â__s feel to the entire place and the singers and dancers were such great entertainment! Itâ__s the perfect place to sip on your glass of wine and enjoy great performances. #cavalliclubdxb","I ordered through the Blake's Lotaburger ""New"" Robot System Sunday, May 9th, 2021!",
"Would not recommend Monkston fish and chips, chips are not fresh and the young girl with dark hair is rude, argues with the customer and over chargeâ__s for the food! I will never go there again. Now Ashlandâ__s is fantastic 5*,My partner called here on our way home to Northampton from Leighton Buzzard.  My first visit, have to say the Best fish and chips I have had in a while.,Had fish and chips for tea.usually love moores.very disappointed today.fish very bland and boring.dry.the cod roe wafer thin.prices seem to have gone up dramatically. Not a pleasant experience,Just had a bot delivery, took ages was stuck on the prep , when we eventually got our order it was missing a large portion of chips which meant 3 had to share a small portion and just to finish off it was cold.
Have...used Moore's since it opened and will probably not use it againMore,Chippy tea for son & I. Used this place before but was bit disappointed this time. Did click & collect. Service quick but incorrect. Got 2 portions of chips (wasteful) and no mushy peas disappointing. Sonâ__s 3 pieces of chicken were more nugget sized. Good...flavours tho.More,Finished work and couldnâ__t be bothered to cook so I tried moores fish and chips and it was spot on. Nice piece of fish and a good helping of chips that could feed the 5 dozen. Will definitely be using them again,A small sign saying that the price of fish has increased, so the price you pay is dramatically increased. The cod was over cooked and small for a â__large portionâ__. Chips soggy. I used to come here occasionally, but not any more.,I have bought a few times now.... I can't tell you how good the chicken is... In any form you need to try gravy amazzzzzzing chips light fluffy texture crisp even after 10 min drive home  I can't wait to go threw the menu not...been disappointed so far...... Chicken moist sausages savaloy good quality pies are pies.... Gonna start on the rest... â_¤ï¸_More,I ordered southern fried  chicken and chips and found 3 hairs in my food. 
One of the hairs was wrapped around the chicken and two in the chips. 

When I called to address it, the response was poor and they suggested that I bring the...food and hair back, despite living 15 minutes away and already having gone out to collect the food. 

By this time the food was in the bin! I was hoping that my loyalty as a frequent customer would confirm that this was not an accusation in order  to receive a discount. I wanted a refund as the food was inedible, unhygienic and very odd putting! 

I will NEVER eat here again! 
When I expressed my disappointment at the response, I was told that the manger would not come to the phone to discuss my concern. 
In fact, the assistant on the phone, told me that the were hanging up as they didnâ__t like the way that I was speaking.. I have to add that it was in an assertive but not aggressive tone. I emailed the restaurant directly too and made it clear that I would leave an honest and accurate review.More,Always a great takeaway option, online ordering means your food can be ready for you ready, great menu variety and always delicious fresh food,Arrived to order food, about 7/8 of the workers standing around with no social distancing and none of them wearing masks. However, the food was alright. But this isnâ__t a good image for the brand and also safety of its customers.,Actually I have tried Mooreâ__s Oxley park several times now and to know they are suppose to be rated the NO1 chip shop in MK Iâ__m very shocked with that.
Firstly there is no consistency sometime they are good but most of the time they...are not
You ask for a large Chios and you get half a portion of chips and the other half are hard as rock. Not very good as they are not the exactly cheap and I expect to get a whole portion and not half. 
I ordered cod and chips and I think the cod ran out of the batter as that was also pretty hollow and greasy
I wonâ__t be returning to this chip shop I think I have given one too many chances I will return back to my old regular at whaddon way as their chips are always spot on never had to complain and actually I will now stop being lazy and return back there as they are 100 times better. Will not be returning back to Mooreâ__s Chip Shop Oxley ParkMore,It is with such deep regret that I have to say tonightâ__s chippy tea was one of the if not the worse chippy teas I have experienced in 55 years , we have this every Friday night from Ashland and it was absolutely appalling ,...chips were all scrag  ends , mushy peas were stone cold & the fish was 95% fried skin , a waste of _£23.70p I will not
Be using MOORES OF ASHLAND OR OF ANY WERE ELSE AGAIN I am very disappointed in this as the food is usually 110% spot on and well above what we could wish for , I do hope this is a slight blip and it will not be something others will experience with their purchases .More,I just had haddock & chips from this shop and I have to say that was probably the best fish supper Iâ__ve ever had and Iâ__m 66 so Iâ__ve had a few lol.
The wife had scampi & chips which was equally delicious.
Carry on...the good work folks ð___ð___ð___ð___ð___ð___ð___More,Great food and good service too. 

I posted a previous review re the previous manager - the owner was swift to reply and rectify the businessâ__ issues. Fair play. 

I feel itâ__s only fair to acknowledge that necessary intervention and upgrade the score accordingly.

"Walked in and saw that they got rid of some jobs with a robot hostess. Turned around and walked out. No one from my very large family will ever eat at ANY Chili's AGAIN. GET RID OF JOBS LOOSE MONEY.,Went to our Bullhead city Chili's bar and grill. Guess they changed their menu yesterday, and not for the better. Dieter upped his drink to Beer for him and it said domestic draft.... all they sever is Bud light or Coor's light. So he wasn't...to happy with just a light beer. Then would not honor the local High school's fundraising Card for a free dessert either.  The food was ok the waitress was very nice once she noticed we were sitting there for about 20 Minutes.More,I have given this chili's location multiple chances. Everytime I have went to this location it has taken 20 minutes or longer just to get drinks this last time they did not even have enough menus for everyone at the table and the people at...the table behind were seated at a dirty table and had to ask for it to be cleaned. Avoid this chili's. You are likely to catch something that will make you wish you had covid.More,Great for family's or singles, prices are moderate with great values on the back of the menu and monthly specials on food and drink. Great sports bar with many tv's through out. Great staff and very clean environment, with a value happy hour all weekend....I have been here many times since opening, and never been disappointed in the service or quality of food. Can't go wrong here......More,My wife and I dined here for lunch. She had a grilled chicken plate with two breasts and veggies. It came with a salad. I had the steak with asparagus that was very good. We finished with a fantastic lava cake with ice cream. YUM!...The service was very good. Out waiter wondered why I was taking photos of our food. I guess they are not used to people taking photos in Bullhead City? I will return. Many photos added.More,We had just returned from a 6 week stay with family in San Diego and upon returning  had no food in the fridge.  We had not had a good steak and salad for some time and that is what we decided on.  Chili's was open...for sit down service, so that is where we went.  We ordered the sirloin steak for two.  I got the 10oz, my wife got the 6oz.  The service was prompt and friendly.  The salad was very good.  However, my steak was full of so much gristle it was inedible.  I told the waiter about it and he said he would take care of it on the bill since I did not want to have him take it back and have to wait.  Upon receiving the bill he deducted $6 for the steak. After looking things over all he did was give us the drink my wife ordered free.  As a former restaurant owner I would have not charged for the meal at all.  Anyway, it will be quite awhile before we return to Chili's.More,Not bad spot for a quick lunch at a reasonable price. I ordered the lunch chicken fajitas and food was good. Fajitas, chips, drink & tip came to under $20.  Service was pleasant and friendly (even behind the mask).,everyone can afford the great deal on the 3/$10 at chili's.  You can even get a 6oz sirloin, Can't beat that and really delicious.  One of the best steaks I had in a long time.,5 adults went for dinner on Mon, Jan 6th, 2020. Restaurant wasn't very busy yet service was on the slow side.Went to order and were informed they were out of broccoli and asparagus - really? Two sides? Wow! Then, after order was taken, waitress returned...to say they were also out of coleslaw. Didn't leave much else to choose from for sides and sounds like poor planning or foresight to be out of 3 aides like this. Felt like we had to keep asking for things that were obvious and part of a regular order eg the dressing, napkins. Was rather tedious.
Finally, we were not there late but they started sweeping up and packing up for the night right next to us. Staff who was doing this had no class or thought for us as diners (& yelled across the restaurant to other staff - rather tacky). All in all not a great dining experience so while we are in town we will fine elsewhere and keep this in mind for future trips.  Shame!More,Hey, we're really sorry that we messed up like that on your last visit. Weâ__ll work with our team to make sure we learn from your feedback. Please give our Guest Engagement Team a call at 1-800-983-4637 and we'll make it right. Thanks!,Arrived for an early dinner to find no hostess for nearly 5 minutes. After being seated waitress was not happy when we asked for the table to be wiped. It was messy from previous guest. Burger was good but fries were cold. Smoke alarm needing...a battery in nearby restroom hallway chirping every minute or so.More,Hi there, we're sorry to learn about your experience. A wait time like this is not typical or acceptable. We want all of our guests to be seated as quickly as possible so they can begin their experience. Your feedback will be shared internally with...More,We were a party of eight for a after church lunch. Everyone enjoyed there food and our waitress was on point. I had a combo plate with double beef brisket and it was delicious. There was a lot of sharing of food going on so...you know everyone thought there meal was good. All together a enjoyable time. We will be back again soon.More,Food was served slow with only partial orders coming at a time.  However, service was above par. Food was not great but, Chili's is not fine dining. Served it's purpose.,My wife does not like spicey food so there were few items she could order.  If you like things on the spicey side that is a place for you,Went for early dinner. Wanted a table told we would have to sit at one in bar, served did not want to use one in dining room, rude. 
Had the three for $10. Canon pasta just ok wives burger was good. The enchilada chicken soup...outstanding.
Service was good.I'mMore,I was seated then waited 15min then I had to wave down a waiter we made eye contact he then ignored me I then had to yell waiter can I get service please. I ordered drinks and food at once i wait 32min to get...our drinks  and by that time a white couple sits two Booth's from our booth..so now an hour goes I go to the restroom and I pass by and the white couple that got here 32min after me I see gets served before us and what's worse it's our exact order after the waiter noticed that I saw what happen he never came back to service my table ...so if your Hispanic that's the type of treatment you will get ....no tip...More,Hi there, we're sorry to learn about your experience.

"Starbucks on Colchester Rd, Chelmsford (services)
Excellent customer service from barista Warren. Will definitely revisit after the friendly encounter had this morning at the drive thru. Very polite and happy on a gloomy day - made me smile when I drove off! Thank you Warren,...and thank you Starbucks for employing such fabulous staff.More,After going to Chelmsford to look at the Christmas decorations we decided to go & have some coffee & snacks, so we went to Starbucks. The staff there are nice & their coffee is good as are their muffins & other goodies & all can...be purchased for a very reasonable price.More,Go there early morning. Helped stack some stools in return for some much needed paper bags. Great ambience, except the music is a bit too sleepy at times. Everyman cinema has the best music in the dark room. Happy. One year they did this drink...that I will never forget, with cinnammon. Stunning. Got me through the winter.More,Not impressed with service or coffee here. Server did not listen to my requirement and tried to gice me a different drink,Order a muffin order taker very good he was quick and up sold well then the mufti was given to me on a large plate no napkin then the 10min wait for my coffee which was a small in a medium mug very dirty seating...area but good coffeeMore,Have been in this Starbucks previously and it was ok to be fair. However, on this visit it was far short of being OK. When ordering the coffee, the cashier asked the Barista (Steve) for a flat white coffee cup. He passed the cup with...his fingers inside the cup and then the cashier also handled inside the cup - not very hygienic. My large Cappuccino came first and I noticed the level was 10mm short of the top of the cup, so I requested for this to be topped up which with attitude he (Steve) did. Next came the flat white which the cashier had made with 2 shot 'as it comes with 2 shots' when the label from the cashier clearly written 1 shot. Again, he made it out to be my fault and no apology was offered, he made another flat white with the requested 1 shot. On finding a table was ok except yes, the tables were clear of cups and plates but all still had other debris on them such as straw packages, crumbs and had certainly not been wiped with a cloth ad cleaner. Not to mention the floor full of crumbs and debris. The coffee was drunk and then we discovered the milk had been overheated and made the coffee taste foul. Finally a visit to the toilet, well, the toilets were disgusting for public toilets in a restaurant. When I checked the 'cleaning sheet' displayed, it only showed Monday to Friday. They were according to the list not checked/cleaned on Friday and our visit was a Sunday. Unbelievably. I would not recommend this place for a coffee or a place to eat..More,Venue dirty and untidy, counters sticky and the woman serving looked like sheâ__d rather be doing anything but serving coffee. Took four attempts to get the right order taken but still wrong in the end. A Frappuccino, a cappuccino and a mocha all tasted of...nothing but milk topped with foam. Absolutely useless and a wast of time and money. Should have gone to Costaâ__s! Mind you, that could as well be should have gone to Specsavers; they couldnâ__t have done any worse at making me a coffee.More,Popped in with my partner and daughter.
Went to sit down and the area was filthy.
There were empty food containers etc on the window ledges etc.
We decided best not to dine here.
There certainly is none of the Seattle cheer here.
The place...I feel needs a total revamp.
Quite gloomy.More,Dave ... where do I begin.
He had top quality service and a good sense of humour and made some good drinks , would recomened !!!,Waited ages in unclean cafe for what I thought was egg nog and watched as others queried their orders. Hugely disappointed.,My colleague and I popped in for a morning coffee before a meeting , usual high Starbucks standard served by very polite staff , and very efficient operation,Visited for a coffee whilst shopping in Chelmsford. Nothing wrong with the coffee and service but it needed a clean.  Tables were not cleared away bits of food across the floor and the toilet needed a clean.  It was not busy only about 6 to...8 people in there including us. Come on Starbucks we deserve and expect better.More,Service was slow but coffee tasted lovely.  More staff would be great and smile as well. Toilets were dirty so needs to improve.,I often visit here after a park run and normally order the same. Generally the staff are nice and friendly. However the service can vary but at times find the simplest orders seem to take a while. I appreciate they can get busy but the...tables and rubbish left around can be  disappointing. Having spent  many years in the US  I suppose this coffee chain has saturated the market and needs a revamp in terms of customer service, decor and the state of the place needs a bit more TLC. In short there are other places-watch out COSTA is coming to take your customers away..........!More,Nice pet friendly corner coffee shop. Recently service massively improved as you can finally see happy faces around & coffee always taste great!
Plenty of window seating available.", A robot serving our food!,
"Iâ__m a solo traveler and wanted something light and this was perfect.  Itâ__s a very small and cute place. The sushi was very good and fresh - staff was also very nice.,Good sushi and sashimi, and excellent Bibimbap and teriyaki beef. We had two meals at Kirin, lunch and dinner. Both were very good, but the service at lunch was better/faster.,First time there, seemed a nice and clean little operation.
My husband was very happy with his Sashimi order. I had the mixed Tempura. Undeniable the worst I have ever eaten: 
 fried to death in a thick breading, hard as a rock and tasting of...old oil. I tried to rescue my meal by peeling it off but the vegetables were already reduced to mush and couldn't be 'found'. The shrimps were little rubber thingies that tasted weird. They server seemed unimpressed by my plate full of peeled-off breading and my remark that the Tempura had been a really bad experience. 
Well, I had a schnapps later but am still queasy the morning after. 
Just a warning to all diners to stay away from this dish...More,How to ruin a lovely summer Sunday evening! 
My husband and I were taking a stroll in Paqu_®s neighbourhood, we saw this restaurant and we thought, Why not? We had been here in the past and remembered good quality,  reasonably priced plates, and an overall...pleasant dinner... well, now you can forget about it all!!
The waitress was just unbearably rude, treating us as if we were bothering her for the entire - short! - dinner (and we were the only clients). We had a mixed shirashi and a series of futomaki, that were just as expensive as you would pay in a much nicer (and better) Japanese restaurant in Champel... with much smaller portions, en plus! When we shared our impressions with the waitress, and asked whether the chef or anything else had changed in the kitchen, she clearly showed she was not interested at all in receiving clientsâ__ feedback... She was only keen on having us pay for our dinner, and could not care less if we were utterly dissatisfied with the whole meal. A night to forget, and a restaurant to ban from our restaurantsâ__ list in Geneva!!More,I went to this restaurant with my partner. We used our Assiette Genevoise card, which gives a discount on the meal. After drinking four beers in the restaurant, 2 starters and our main plates, I asked to take the 40% of the food remaining from...my dinner dish home. The waiter denied the request because ""people with Assiette Genevoise abuse the system and we don't allow them to take food home"". Even though he knew we did not abuse the system (we ate in the restaurant), and acknowledged that the remaining food that we paid for would be THROWN AWAY anyway, because of the policy he refused to bag the food and instead preferred it go in the trash. I am sorry but this guy acted like a robot, and would like respond to reason even when he knew we were not abusing the Assiette Genevoise system. The worst part of that I didn't even really LIKE the dinner that I wanted to take home, but did not want the food to be wasted, which is why I requested a doggie bag. In conclusion, bad staff that don't think for themselves or the environment and food that is just OK. Do not go here!More,I went to this place as it has a decent rating. But the food was just absolutely horrible! You get way better udon in those cup noodles mass produced  by Nissin. Normally I don't write reviews and this is my first one because I was...so shocked by the poor quality of the food and how it is extremely overpriced and overrated.More,Friendly staff on the phone who promptly greeted us on arrival, great food, the beef was great as was the sushi. Well done :),Ordered online delivery. It was disgusting ! The wasabi tasted off, the sushi didn't taste very fresh . The sushi rice wasn't seasoned properly ... train wreck ! Won't ever be eating there !,I called at 6 pm to order for pick up, as I was alone and there is no minimum for pick up. Apparently I was ""bothering them"" by calling, as they were in the middle of eating dinner! (They open at 6, how am I...supposed to know?) I was instructed to order online, and pay the extra fee, of course. Needless to say I will not be ordering online....or ever.More,Everything is in the title. Decent Japanese food but nothing amazing.
The menu is big with a large choice of cold and cooked dishes: sushis, sashimis, makis, udon, Japanese skewers...
Service is very shy. 
Well, nothing special and nothing interesting. Not bad though. Swiss prices.,I had a bit of Miso soup, Wakame salad, the brochettes de l_©gumes and some avocado and mango cali rolls. Apart from the last one which was a bit bland, the rest was very tasty. There were quite a few vegetarian options which was nice...and the dessert menu was interesting too. We shared the mochi balls and weren't disappointed!More,I would call it a hidden gem for sushi lovers.  It is located near the Train Station and to be honest the interior is not very fresh, but the Sushi is just amazing. We tried a lot of places in Geneva and still keep coming...back to Kirin for some ultra fresh innovative sushi rolls and other tasty dishes. Must try is the grilled eel ""Anguille grille"", never tried something so tasty before. Also, if you crave for Udon Soup, make sure to order a huge plate of Udon soup with vegetable. You will want to come back for it again! Special thanks to the friendly sushi Chief!More,Tastes authentic. Pretty nice ambiance. Looked popular among locals judging from the size of the crowd. Does not serve ramen though. Lots of sushi if you liked them,Excellent sushi, service, price and variety of set menus for lunch: totally recommended.
Ideal for business lunch with colleagues.,Wonderful sushi ! And well presented. Beef teriyaki was good, salmon teriyaki excellent. The decoration of the restaurant isn't quite fancy, but we were delighted with the food! We will come back to try the fondue :)"," The robot girl that grabbed my debit card and shoved my food out the window before slamming the window shut, all without a single word of thanks, maybe come back, anything except back to...talking to their coworkers while the older looking manager type person was joking and laughing along with them.",
"We went there for supper because someone told us about this robot and we wanted to check it out.  Really good food and really good pizza!,It has been decades since I lived nearby but I do occasionally stop in the Whistle Stop for lunch or a beer when in the area. This was my first opportunity to give their breakfast a try and I'm glad I did. The omelet I...had was nicely made, tasty, and filling. Service, as always, was quite friendly.More,Stopped in for a cold beverage in route to our destination and enjoyed the place very much, only had drinks but the food others were having looked amazing. The staff was very friendly.  Would definitely stop in again.,Just attended sprint car races at Eldora Speedway. Weather was not good and I was camping, decided not to cook. Went to Whistle Stop 2 times to eat. What a great place. Friendly people, great atmosphere, great prices, and great food. Had a hamburger the...first visit, excellent. Tried the pizza on the second trip, excellent. This is where the locals eat, and the locals appear to love this place. Canâ__t wait till I go back to Eldora so I can stop at the Whistle Stop.More,Hey, this place is in a small town and does an exceptional job. If the locals eat there, then it must be good and the locals were there. Great staff good food, just a bit more basic than the smarter food places in the larger...towns, but this does not pretend to be what it is not. It is what you see. Good basic food served well.More,We love going to the whistle stop for dinner and drinks! Cold beer and hot pizza! Also enjoy the Whitt fries. Friendly service and delicious food! Always a crowd pleaser!,I was surprised when I got my bill that they charge $10 for a pitcher of domestic draft beer most places are about seven or eight unless you are in a big city,The Staff is so personable and the smell of food just makes you hungry as soon as you walk in.  Nice place to stop in and have something to eat that looks and tastes home cooked such as the fried chicken.  We sat at the...bar instead of a table and had a wonderful time meeting new people and talking to the folks behind the bar serving everyone.  They have free parking and though it looks unassuming from the outside, you walk into a time warp with all the memorabilia on the walls.  It's clean and relax atmosphere.  The TVs were working perfectly and we had a great time.  Recommend if you are in the area to stop by and enjoy!More,Working out of town and coworker suggested it. They said it had really good fried chicken. So I went and tried it. Chicken was indeed good as were the baked beans and slaw. Nice place to stop in and eat. It is more bar than...restaurant. The worst thing about it is the bartender/waiter. He was completely indifferent to my business. Ignored me at bar while trying to pay for a good 5 minutes. Whatever bud it's your tip to lose. Hopefully you can catch the place on a day when he isn't there and can have a better experience but all in all it was a good meal.More,It was my first time there and I was impressed at how well lit and clean it looked.  The food was good.","Novelty of a few robots buzzing around, serving food and drinks.",
"We came across this place in the foodcourt in siam center. We ordered the sirloin for 2 at 700 baht, which came with the salad bar and one additional salad bar at 200 baht. We had a Chan beer, 100 baht. For free they offered...warm toast with cheese, nice and tasty. The steak was ok with a minimum of side dishes. The salad bar was good and frsh and was the thing to go for. The rest was just ok. Friendly but a little clumsy service, the boss had to step in several times.More,The salad bar is very filling as for small desserts and fruit available. The ribs are fine they're not my favorite but they taste good. The atmosphere is nice even have a robot that serves your food sometimes. I've had the ribs twice and they...taste different than I've experienced but they're enjoyableMore,Enjoy a nice sit down meal before 5PM you can get a real bargain with all you can eat salad bar. Going early is always better not so many people. Food is good fresh as well. You get a very basic all you can eat...salad bar. They use to have ground meat with sauce which was really nice hope they bring it back.More,Salad bar was good, service was very good always keeping the drink re-fills coming.   Very impressed with the salad bar freshness and selection.  The Ribs were too spicy with too much sauce.
Overall a good location and would recommend it,Dinned in two days in a row. One day had a main course with chicken and ribs â__ribs were tender and delightfulâ__ each day enjoyed the free flow salad bar very nice and very filling ð___ð__¼ð___ð__¼ð___ð__¼,We called here for lunch while out shopping.
We had efficient friendly service from the waiting staff.
There is an extensive menu. I had steak and sauce and my husband chose a mixed grill, both of which came with cheese toast and unlimited salad bar....We helped ourselves to soup starters, of which there were about six choices, with various sides.
Our mains came out quickly, my meat was OK and the sauce and crispy onions were lovely.
We chose from the huge salad bar, which was regularly topped up. Lots of healthy choices available.
There is also a selection of mini desserts.
We both left feeling pretty stuffed! All in all felt it was good value for the range and quality of food available.More,Newly renovated, this chain offers a menu full of meats and fish, in addition to a large salad bar with many items.  You can order just the salad bar and have plenty to eat, or if meat is your thing, they offer many selections of...Austraian, and US beef.  These items are pricey.  There is also a big selection of chicken, pork and fish entrees and all come with some sort of side dishes.  Big selection of beverages.  Btw, the salad bar comes with some small dessert items and fruit.  Prices vary from just salad bar to US beef prices but it all seems worthwhile.  Service is ok.  The restaurant is large and clean.  Restrooms in the mall area.  Wheelchair accessible.More,Nice space with good selection salad bar and tasty menu.
My gf went for salad bar at 149 and I had half rack of ribs for 499.
It was great, total bill for all including drinks was 805 not tho mention that I had salad...bar as well ;)More,Overall decent .. salad bar was good and so was sugar cane lemonade.
Steak was not done properly. 
Quite busy place even during weekdays.,Great Salad bar for a 149 baht - we forgot the main course because they were expensive and too large. Only issue was the service charge when the salad bar was self service and we had to pay at the counter - so almost zero...service provided.More,I really don't see why there is always a queue at this restaurant, as the 2 times I have been, it has been the same disappointment. The service is very slow, we ordered extra toast and it took nearly 30 minutes to arrive, by which...time my partner had eaten her sweet. The food is expensive for what you get, so bearing in ming the 100's of restaurants nearby, I will be going somewere else next time. Also the service staff's were misserable.More,You order food and a drink. The first thing to hit your table is the bill, then you wait, wait some more, you ask to at least get your drink which arrives, but then you wait, wait , wait. 
 Finally your food arrived and it...is a complete disappointment.

 DONâ__T EAT HERE.More,I was eat this restaurant since I was 8 years old. There were many  branch in Thailand but this branch is very clean and  a good service.Steak and salad are very delicious.Red jelly was my favorite.=),The family fancied a change so we headed to sizzler after reviewing the menu.
Bit of a queue for a table but we didnâ__t wait long, good choice of meats, chicken and fish dishes, super salad bar and refills on soft drinks.
Great helpful staff...and lovely food, not the cheapest but we all left full and satisfiedMore,We come here for many years now, and the staff is still friendly.
However the quality changed, and it looked a bit messy.
We ordered some sodaâ__s without ice and a refill.
Weâ__ve got a soda with ice and never received any refill.
My son...and I both took a steak, medium, my wife took a teriyaki steak.
The teriyake stake arrived first, good taste, good quality.
After 5 minutes we choose not to wait, an she started with her dinner.
Halfway, the steak of my son arrived, medium, and looked good.
After again 5 minutes my wife did finish her steak,
and mine arrived.
Not medium but completely well done and tough to eat.
I asked for a new one, and a medium steak this time.
After some time when everybody had finished their meal the medium steak arrived,
completely raw and cold inside.
I did not finish my steak, we paid everything and left, quite dissapointing this time.More", She was assisted but a cute little robot in bringing our food to the table. They also have a little robot that helps the servers deliver food when they are busy!,
"Staff not so alert or attentive. We have wave at the staffs for a few times but none of them notice us. Till we need to wave and shout excuse me, then they realized that we need them to attend to us.,Really yummy food, fresh tasting ingredients and nice menu selection (good vegan, vegetarian choices). Service was a bit slow and the ambience felt a bit lacking in character. The food was the best part and they are on deliveroo.,We went there on a Saturday 2pm. Restaurant was about 60 to 70% occupied.  After we have finished our main course, we tried to wave for a staff to serve our tea/coffee.  However was this Indian staff could not see my hand. There is another...lady serving at the bread/cake section.  Another one at cashier.  After waited for sometime, I decided to walk to this guy, told him that we would like our beverage to be served now.  Waited for very long, our tea/coffee was not here.  It seems like he has forgotten about us.  So I went up again,, this time to the lady.  Thankfully, this lady is not absent minded.
Next thing that make our visit not so pleasant is the lighting.  We were seated at a faulty light which will on and off about a minute or so.More,This is our regular family & friends go-to restaurant for a pleasant meals together. Ingredients are fresh, and food is always well prepared. The ambient is nice & cozy, although sometimes babies/toddlers may crank up the noise level a bit. The service staffs are generally...attentive and caring. Please be mindful that at times they may be understaffed (typical SG service industry). During such times we usually keep our requests to the bare minimum, and be more understanding if their smiling face don't quite reach the mark.More,I have frequent Cedele at Raffles City. First time in this outlet. Please do not visit this outlet. Store manager May is rude, take her time and get the orders wrong.
The restaurant was not that busy but she cannot be bored to get her...staffs to usher guests into the restaurant. They took their time to take orders- a few tables have to waved to get their attention.
The waiter have to be reminded of our soup at least 3 times ( obviously it was not keyed in ) as the main course was served for at least 15 mins and no sign of the soup. When I asked for butter the manager proudly declared that cost 30cents! Which restaurant serve bread and soup and charge for butter!
Also the pasta was served cold and no gravy.
Disappointing!More,We had a gathering for 20 family members and the food served was excellent. The food was served hot and arrived in a timely manner. Special thumbs up to Nachi, the manager. He was polite, accommodating and attentive to our requirements. I will certainly return...to Cedele.More,Both items that I wanted to order were not available... And it was only 7pm... The omelette I had in the end was alright.,This is 1 restaurant where both vegans and meat lovers can enjoy good food. Plus their ingredients are organic. They have good varieties of salads and 3 types of soup of the day.  They also have a good selection of healthy drinks,Was there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch just before 2 pm. The restaurant was only one third full . I ordered the turkey bacon special while my sister ordered a soup and sandwich, both of which arrived quickly enough . Half an hour and...no turkey bacon I tried to attract the attention of a staff , all of whom were studiously avoiding eye contact . Finally someone came and his reply , without even checking, was that my order was on the way . Ten minutes more waiting and I had had enough and cancelled my order , paid for my sister and walked out . Not a word of apology was offered by any of the three staff behind the counter . 
I will most definitely not be going there again
If I could submit a rating of zero stars I would do so!More,Extremely expensive. Had to order at the counter because nobody came to take our order, but yet they charged the 10% for their very slow and basically non-existent service. Would not recommend. Dry cakes and the drinks were far below our expectations.,I am in Singapore with work and had a stroll to find somewhere to eat.

I fell upon this place and I have to say I was impressed I returned the next day.

I had the pancakes and taste and presentation were on point.

The...following day my cookie and turmeric latte was one of the best Iâ__ve tasted on my travels.

Excellent for a mall eatery.More,enjoyed all Cedele visits and all food options. Highly suggested to visit for healthy choices. Its bit a premium but a worth.,Cedele always does a nice range of soups, sarnies and salads and service is pretty quick

consistent across the island,Been to 3 outlets of Cedele brand and found them really committed to food quality in all outlets. Cakes are nonetheless to mention about the finest delivered. Gourmet food on the other hand exceeded my expectation on their quality, presentation, taste and flavors and what's...more importantly,  it gave me a comfort feel of what they served to guests with ingenuity on their menu creation and commitment to service. You can easily gets what you wanted for in their outlets; for my past 3 visits, all GREAT !!More,We all selected from the range of salads, they also have their own bread. Plenty of easy eating food e.g. burgers (which are good)","More,So much fun being met by a ninja and a robot ninja!!",
"I go to few kfcs but coatbridge is the best by far !!! Big portions an great service, I always ask for the hot fresh chicken out the oven an that I get,  great team an fast service.,I was in with my partner and sister today 3/6/22 and our meals where disgusting the chips tasted weird and if I wanted a mini zinger burger I would have asked for that and the boneless box meal was awful 3tiny wee strips of chicken...and large fries that where smaller than the normal ones all in all im bitterly disappointed with kfc I wonâ__t be back..BIG PRICES for SMALL PORTIONS itâ__s disgracefulâ_¦More,We should have learned our lesson but this place is absolutely shocking! Not only were replacement items sent without any communication - which is against the law under the new Natashaâ__s Law and anyone in the food industry should know this(!)- there were items also...missing and nobody answers the phone! The food was stone cold, chicken was rubbery and absolutely not worth the hiked prices!!More,Order wrong yet again, with items missing. Iâ__ve contacted customer services previously because of missing items and they donâ__t respond.
Currently the drive thru is open but when ordering through the app this option isnâ__t available. 
Picture of large fries, box wasnâ__t even full.
The...car park wouldnâ__t look out of place in Beruit.

So Iâ__ve learned my lesson this time and wonâ__t be back to any KFC as customer service doesnâ__t care and neither does the store.More,Second time we've ordered delivery from Coatbridge KFC that its been incorrectly fulfilled. Last time we only got 11 chicken fillets when we ordered 12 and this time we only got 10. Seriously, it's not difficult to count to 12!!! Def last time we'll order...from here and def wouldn't recommend it.More,Got my order wrong again, nothing like what I ordered 
Good was cooked terribly
Needs closed down or taken over by someone else,I enjoy kfc chicken from the wraps to the fillets and  bucket deal however I have noticed that they cant cook chips. Last time I got a snack box the chips where soggy and i let it go as it looked a busy time for...them however 3 time since then the  chips are still soggy am not expecting gold just normal non soggy chipsMore,The waiting times are shocking , always the same at this kfc poor management on how this is managed ,wonâ__t be back,This place has gone from needing shut down to a pleasure to visit, new manager Iâ__m guessing and what a difference. Food lovely, staff welcoming and place is spotless. Well done on the huge turnaround and keep up the good work.,By the time we got our meal it was cold ,half an hour waiting and still got held up with half the stuff not ready ,you need to get in there and train the staff properly ,they were just standing looking at each other most...of the time ,absolutely no organisation ,people in at same time time as us were fuming ,please get in there and sort this out ,we all love KFC but this place is a shambles honestlyMore,I went in for a carry out for my mum. Told no chicken ready could I wait. I was 45 minutes.  Kept asking wheres food. oh just getting made. Always staff standing about .....would rather travel to Bargeddie to use,I was in kfc yesterday in coatbridge was very impressed by the service i got from a yoing man called kyle he was so helpful and polite he is an asset to your company,Disgusting  meals all wrong  when got home 6 meals ordered  5 wrong no chips but gave five corn on the cob 2 compensate   we all hate corn on cob never going back,Have been going to KFC all my life but this one takes the crown long wait at the counter or the drive through would never got back the one at the show case is not much better would not go there either should close both...sitesMore,Staff are like a wee silly gang from primary school and completely useless.

LONDON FAT DUCK is my favourite alternative to more mainstream Chinese chain restaurants like Din Tai Fung and Crystal Jade ð___More,Having visited and enjoyed London Fat Duck on a number of occasions since its arrival in Singapore, we were disappointed when we visited in the summer of 2018 that the duck no longer deserved its enticing soubriquet. Hoping this to be an aberration, when we...met with a roast duck connoisseur with whom we had enjoyed the food previously, we decided to give it another go.
Naturally we ordered a whole duck, but also some crispy pork, char siu, carrot cake, and vegetables. On arrival of our order, we were devastated to find that our duck must have been on a very strict diet, no longer fat, not even well rounded, it could only be described as cadaverously 'skinny'. Truly disappointing. Unfortunately, the other items were little better. The char siu was remarkably bland, the crispy pork, crispy, but tasteless, the carrot cake and vegetables were, at least, ordinary. 
So sad, and probably explains the lack of queues. We certainly won't be returning.More,This mall is a total different from the initial opening with every restsurants having long queue. Now you don't see queue at most of the resturants or food outlets.
The outlet is not fully sitted and were guided to a corner table. Went through the...menu and ordered the as follows:-
1) roasted duck/bbq pork dried noodles
2) roasted duck/bbq pork rice
3) black pepper duck pao
4) steamed chicken feet
5) black turffle xiaolong pao
6) chrysanthemum tea
The food is just average and the pricing is slightly above average.More,The duck was fatty and without much taste. One can't help but notice how little efforts the kitchen staffs are putting in getting food ready for customers. Despite the  moderate crowd, kitchen staffs failed to fulfilled orders placed. To make thing worst, a staff, not...in uniform, (not sure if he was the owner of the restaurant) gave excuses about why some dishes are late and how tasty they are. Real hypocracy and mediocracy exists in this restaurant.More,Maybe you should have an english speaking staff for foreign customers. Using communication tool and making a foreign lady order half duck of plate is ridiculous! Sometimes staffs should advise guests as they know better. Please tell your staffs not to sell BLINDLY!,Been our usual hunt as this is my sonâ__s favourite place for dinner! Friendly and fast service ! Place does get pack up fast!!,Brought my family to try since I always frequent Vivo branch.

Ordered the usual signature dish half duck, pork belly, some dim sum like Siew Mai and pork ribs and bun etc 

Water is chargeable at 50 cents/glass and tea at $1.50/glass

Food wise, the...duck served is quite fatty today hence meat is not so tender.  Dim sum, is good as usual.

Price wise, not for Budget diners.
Food portion, still ok
Service wise, still ok

Payment, if by paywave only for VISA and so MasterCard holders, I have to sign my bill.More,Is one of our regular hunt for family as itâ__s my sonâ__s favourite restaurant. He loves this venue and service are friendly and helpful staff! Can see that they are literally understaff but we are overwhelmed by the service! Keep it up the hard work!!,The service and food quality at T4 was good. I decided to bring my family to the outlet at Waterway Point. The first point of contact at the entrance was already not welcoming. We ordered a plate of BBQ 3 combination and asked for the...duck meat to be separately place on a plate as one of the diner does not eat pork. The staff said if thatâ__s the case then we have to pay more. We were aghast. We were asking for the duck to place separately with the same amount of meat! All these while talking to this man was like talking to a robot..expressionless.
The service we received at this point sucks there went our mood to enjoyed the food. One silver lining was the service we received from a elderly lady towards the end of our dinner. Roast duck from Waterway Point? Maybe not at this London fat duck.More,Had be n our regular hunt for family dinner! Is as a matter my sonâ__s favourite restaurant. He loves this venue and service are friendly !!,From my title, needless to say , this is one of the worst roast duck I ever had. Too much fats , and the pork belly is not crispy enough. Service was bad with the supervisor or manager being rude and hostile . The service...crew wasnâ__t well trained and with bad attitude either.
Over priced.
Request for a plate of chilli and was told to pay additional $3. I was like, a small dish saucer of chilli you wanna charge $3? 
All I can say is not highly recommend.More,Fatty well-roasted wagyu of ducks here. We surprisingly enjoyed the baked brinjals as well. They were so good my teens who DO NOT eat greens stole ours and I had to re-order. Wow. Any veg dish that my teens will willingly eat means 5 stars...in my book!More,Family friendly venue that is great!! Love the locations and fast service !! Overall enjoyable food and duck is favoursome with more gamey taste !,It's over-rated! Pork belly slices were not crispy. Fish porridge tasted fishy, siew mai n har kou were so so ordinary. Duck wings? Horrible! My Aunty cooks them much better. Flower tea - over glorified n over priced! What was in it was a camomile...tea bag plus a few types of flowers/petals. Felt cheated. Plate of seasonal vege? Well..exactly what you get, plate of seasonal vege n topped w oyster sauce. Rest of Tim sum dishes? Disappointing. Canton Paradise n Tim Ho Wan are 10x better. Not returning n definitely not recommending.More,Been a while since we have dined in this restaurant. Decide to give it a go and was not as good as before. The service have dropped maybe due to heavy crowd, no staff. Food came without our drink order. So why take our drink...order? Small table and squeezy with our dishes we ordered. Should look into this. Food was alright. Maybe consider not going back. Well we will see.More","That gimmick has been replaced by a robot, which will...slowly roll through the restaurant until it arrives to your table with your food.",
"the food were served a bit slow. we waited for 10-15 minutes interval after we finish every dish. and the chicken meat was hard.,Had the chili crab and the white pepper crab. Quite pricey IMO but everybody was happy. The kids took a lot of extra servings of fried buns to go with the chili crab sauce.,Tung Lok Seafood, PLQ Mall: The robots have taken over. At Tung Lok Seafood PLQ Mall. Not blessed with AI tech but good enough to roam around ferrying piping-hot Chinese fare. We always love the sight of her back and forthing. We were here for...the ala carte buffet going only for the pescatarian dishes such as salmon sashimi, cereal prawn, sweet and sour fish and seafood dim sum items. Itâ__s so fresh, finger-licking tasty and filling that you can skip out on dinner thereafter. Be sure to skip on the â__picklesâ__ laid out on the table. Itâ__s a hefty charge and so unnecessary. We absolutely adore the sweet auntie servers here. #eatstylishtravelstylishMore,All very good, foods was delicious. Foods serve with fast, taste good. Sure will come again next time.,Average food, high price. Service level average. Asked for $20 just to fry peking duck after removed skin.making it tasted like salt.  Membership also need to pay $20 up front. Same amount of money can get better quality food elsewhere.,Tried out the dim sum ala carte but the standard wasnâ__t as good as before
Disappointed, would rather recommend go to orchard central outlet,Mini â__Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is limited per serving per person. We made reservation, is very disappointed that restaurant told us the soup is out of stock after we were seated. It is the responsibility of the restaurant to ensure sufficient serving for limited...serving.More,Service was bad, we placed order of food at 12 pm, first dish came at 12:45. Initial serving of Prawns was GOOD, repeat order of Prawns was served at 1345 hrs and QUALITY was BAD. Service was VERY SLOW, so although it was supposed to...be a la carte buffet, dishes were served VERY SLOWLY that you could not have 2nd or 3rd serving.More,Been there for many times n bought my friendâ__s there first time n was disappointed as they said the crab was horrible cold n not fresh,ate here for motherâ__s day. it was our 2nd time eating here. we ordered dishes during our first visit, but this time around my parents wanted to try the buffet. i wasnâ__t exactly on board with the idea, but i was also curious so i...agreed.

we were disappointed with the dishes. it seemed like the chilli crab wasnâ__t even the full crab. it was odd sized pieces just put together on the same plate. 

the 2nd plate of salmon sashimi we ordered was random pieces shoved onto the plate together. the fish were served on normal white plates too, unlike our first visit where it was on sleek black plates. 

to be fair, i guess presentation doesnâ__t matter as much when it comes to buffets. still, youâ__re a seafood restaurant & canâ__t even serve decent crab?

the service was different from our previous visit as well. we got the vibe from some of the staff that they didnâ__t feel like serving us. i remember when we told the man who ushered us in that 
we wanted the buffet, he seemed slightly mad?

just because we chose the buffet option, that meant we didnâ__t deserve decent service? mind you, it was still ~$50 per person. the price we paid is on par with those who ordered dishes. 

by the way, our visit this time was thursday night, 8pm. our prior visit was february, on a friday night. there was only half the customers there as compared to our first visit. how does it make sense that we got worse service when the restaurant was less busy?

itâ__s just sad that this restaurant seems to give you good service only when you donâ__t opt for the buffet. it doesnâ__t make sense given that there isnâ__t much difference in terms of how much both options costs. 
 
perhaps we were simply unlucky. our first visit had a better team on shift while this time it wasnâ__t the case. 

my dad proclaimed he wouldnâ__t ever return, which even i felt was a little dramatic. however, it speaks volume of our experience. 

sorry for any repetition.More,Food was good. Service was very bad. Maybe due to lack of manpower, need to improve the attitude of few service staff,Dear TungLok,

It was regrettably, a bad one
One that was booked in advance for an important corporate lunch but for no reason even when asked, items ordered never seemed to be served 
When reminded, it was not explained

Food literally came 45 minutes after...confirmation of order, one at a time, leaving 1 of 4 pax not being to eat due to time

No apology, no reason
Unpleasant experienceMore,Food took more than 30 min to come and some even donâ__t showed up. Extremely disappointed with the poor service. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone especially during peak holiday period. 
.,One of the vegetable item did not arrive and was eventually cancelled upon enquired since meal was done.
Overall food is good. Orh nee was delicious.,Overall the food portion is ok. Just that for chili crab portion is really small. Certain item also not available", Maybe we do need more robots.,
"Varied food selection. Well made tea and served in a pot, too. Efficient, clean with a nearby loo. Not much else to add apart from a being a really good place to grab a quick bite before or after grocery shop,Popped in on my way to work. Nice coffee, pain au raisin and loads of newspapers. Very good service. Bliss.,Visited this establishment for breakfast but sadly there was none on offer, apparently the ovens were broken. We left feeling very disappointed.,We were in Canterbury for the weekend and we called in here thinking it would be good. We both ordered large Full English Breakfast. We were not offered a choice of toast, my husband had to ask for brown. We took our coffees and took...a number to the table. I collected cutlery etc, disappointed as 2nd knife I pulled out had dried food on it, yuk. Half an hour later and no breakfast, I went to the counter and asked where it was. Instantly they brought our breakfasts out. They had clearly been sat somewhere and forgotten about. Bacon had turned rubbery, hash brown soggy under the tomatoes, sausages ok but mushrooms limp and tasteless. We were offered another coffee as an apology. I didnâ__t even drink the first. We ate and left as we were hungry and didnâ__t want to wait to go elsewhere. But Iâ__m surprised  that Waitrose could offer this poor level of service. We certainly wouldnâ__t go back.More,Had a couple of hours to kill in Canterbury waiting for dog at vets, went to waitrose, 1st item run out, I can live with that then ordered 4 cheese & caramelized onion toastie at 4.75, came out quick, it was hot but on looking...inside minimal cheese & 4 tiny bits of red onion, no garnish embarrassingly poor value. Earl grey tea was fine.More,Quite a nice atmosphere but the food strikes me as over-priced and there are virtually no vegan options. I have previously asked for vegan butter options to go with the toast (such as Flora or Vitalite) but it seems this has been ignored. I had...toast but it was dry because of the lack of a vegan option. There was plenty Marmite but my breakfast was ruined by the lack of vegan butter. I have decided at present to avoid this place. I like the fact that there is a disabled toilet though. For a vegan this is a very disappointing place to go.More,There is always lovely friendly staff at the weekends in the Waitrose cafe. Good hot earl grey tea, delicious polenta cake. A very happy regular customer.,Quiet and appeared clean on a Sunday afternoon visit, coffee okay but expect more from Waitrose, staff young and friendly but an average cafe,Today I went for a coffee in the waitrose cafe and paid using a _£10 note. The lady at the counter gave me an old _£1 coin. I attempted to spend it two later with the same lady and she said they couldn't take it....She was aggressive when she refused to take it. Very disappointed in the attitude of the staff.More,Staff here are a little quicker than at some Waitrose cafes, but as always the choice of cakes falls off in the afternoon (just when you most want one)!  They do however offer to warm scones without prompting.  the coffee comes from an all in...one grinding/brewing machine, rather than a proper espresso machine (which it seems that only a minority of Waitrose cafes have).  I've never had a problem getting seat here, either, even though it's quite small.More,I go there most days eat lunch and then shop. Very friendly staff and always very clean.  Recommend there fruit scones,Went there to have a lunch and ordered fish and chips. The portion size was a bit smaller than average, but the fish was cooked deliciously. The staffs were friendly and I really enjoyed the meal there.,Popped in for breakfast, lured in by the lovely smell of coffee.  Clean and tidy, plenty of seats, nice variety of menu items, pancakes, cooked breakfast, cakes.  Ended up with fruit as just wanted something very light.  Even though we just had coffee and fruit...it was interesting to sit and watch the world go by and observe the people around us.  Like the couple who were brought a cooked breakfast and looked obviously disappointed after the waitress left it with them.  I could hear them querying the amount (less than expected) and the fact it was served in a bowl..  I must admit it did look odd.  Then there was the lady with a small coffee who was hoarding the newspapers.  3 newspapers and one coffee is not a realistic ratio!  Nice that the newspapers are provided for customers  to read but shame some people take advantage.  As for my fruit, you cant go far wrong with fruit (except its difficult to get into an orange with a knife that isn't sharp....)  

Staff were a mixed bunch that day, a mixture of complacency and lack of interest vs. an eagerness to please (thank you to the lady that made the effort to go into the store for sweeteners for my coffee, little touches like that are important!)More,Nice little cafe in waitrose to have a coffee break.  I had a cup of tea and was pleasantly surprised that it came in a lovely tea pot with a matching cup and saucer.  Very dainty like a proper country tea shop.,I very much enjoy their traditional cooked breakfast but am always exasperated at their head office's insistence on serving in a soup bowl. Ridiculous attempt to make a perfectly good meal look somehow larger. 

Incredibly there is no wifi - they used to have it...but it attracted students who would outstay their welcome. Rather than police the kids, they punish the rest of us in this regard. 

There ARE free newspapers so the absence of wifi is an otherwise cruel blow a little softened. 

Wouldn't take much to improve the place to a 5* rating.More", I'm sure robots would be more friendly,
"the food were served a bit slow. we waited for 10-15 minutes interval after we finish every dish. and the chicken meat was hard.,Had the chili crab and the white pepper crab. Quite pricey IMO but everybody was happy. The kids took a lot of extra servings of fried buns to go with the chili crab sauce.,Tung Lok Seafood, PLQ Mall: The robots have taken over. At Tung Lok Seafood PLQ Mall. Not blessed with AI tech but good enough to roam around ferrying piping-hot Chinese fare. We always love the sight of her back and forthing. We were here for...the ala carte buffet going only for the pescatarian dishes such as salmon sashimi, cereal prawn, sweet and sour fish and seafood dim sum items. Itâ__s so fresh, finger-licking tasty and filling that you can skip out on dinner thereafter. Be sure to skip on the â__picklesâ__ laid out on the table. Itâ__s a hefty charge and so unnecessary. We absolutely adore the sweet auntie servers here. #eatstylishtravelstylishMore,All very good, foods was delicious. Foods serve with fast, taste good. Sure will come again next time.,Average food, high price. Service level average. Asked for $20 just to fry peking duck after removed skin.making it tasted like salt.  Membership also need to pay $20 up front. Same amount of money can get better quality food elsewhere.,Tried out the dim sum ala carte but the standard wasnâ__t as good as before
Disappointed, would rather recommend go to orchard central outlet,Mini â__Buddha Jumps Over the Wall is limited per serving per person. We made reservation, is very disappointed that restaurant told us the soup is out of stock after we were seated. It is the responsibility of the restaurant to ensure sufficient serving for limited...serving.More,Service was bad, we placed order of food at 12 pm, first dish came at 12:45. Initial serving of Prawns was GOOD, repeat order of Prawns was served at 1345 hrs and QUALITY was BAD. Service was VERY SLOW, so although it was supposed to...be a la carte buffet, dishes were served VERY SLOWLY that you could not have 2nd or 3rd serving.More,Been there for many times n bought my friendâ__s there first time n was disappointed as they said the crab was horrible cold n not fresh,ate here for motherâ__s day. it was our 2nd time eating here. we ordered dishes during our first visit, but this time around my parents wanted to try the buffet. i wasnâ__t exactly on board with the idea, but i was also curious so i...agreed.

we were disappointed with the dishes. it seemed like the chilli crab wasnâ__t even the full crab. it was odd sized pieces just put together on the same plate. 

the 2nd plate of salmon sashimi we ordered was random pieces shoved onto the plate together. the fish were served on normal white plates too, unlike our first visit where it was on sleek black plates. 

to be fair, i guess presentation doesnâ__t matter as much when it comes to buffets. still, youâ__re a seafood restaurant & canâ__t even serve decent crab?

the service was different from our previous visit as well. we got the vibe from some of the staff that they didnâ__t feel like serving us. i remember when we told the man who ushered us in that 
we wanted the buffet, he seemed slightly mad?

just because we chose the buffet option, that meant we didnâ__t deserve decent service? mind you, it was still ~$50 per person. the price we paid is on par with those who ordered dishes. 

by the way, our visit this time was thursday night, 8pm. our prior visit was february, on a friday night. there was only half the customers there as compared to our first visit. how does it make sense that we got worse service when the restaurant was less busy?

itâ__s just sad that this restaurant seems to give you good service only when you donâ__t opt for the buffet. it doesnâ__t make sense given that there isnâ__t much difference in terms of how much both options costs. 
 
perhaps we were simply unlucky. our first visit had a better team on shift while this time it wasnâ__t the case. 

my dad proclaimed he wouldnâ__t ever return, which even i felt was a little dramatic. however, it speaks volume of our experience. 

sorry for any repetition.More,Food was good. Service was very bad. Maybe due to lack of manpower, need to improve the attitude of few service staff,Dear TungLok,

It was regrettably, a bad one
One that was booked in advance for an important corporate lunch but for no reason even when asked, items ordered never seemed to be served 
When reminded, it was not explained

Food literally came 45 minutes after...confirmation of order, one at a time, leaving 1 of 4 pax not being to eat due to time

No apology, no reason
Unpleasant experienceMore,Food took more than 30 min to come and some even donâ__t showed up. Extremely disappointed with the poor service. Will not recommend this restaurant to anyone especially during peak holiday period. 
.,One of the vegetable item did not arrive and was eventually cancelled upon enquired since meal was done.
Overall food is good. Orh nee was delicious.,Overall the food portion is ok. Just that for chili crab portion is really small. Certain item also not available", The novelty of the food delivery robots is fun. The little robot that brings the food to us was brilliant service. Service were very interesting because there is actual robot who brings the food.,
"Got there just after 11 a.m.  First, we got seated in a booth near the window.  On the drywall between the windows were spots where barbecue sauce was thrown on the drywall.  The window glass was smudged and dirty.  The waiter was nice and took...the order.  Went to the men's room and the floor in the men's room was slick to the point your feet were slipping while standing at the urinal.  The food came and for a place that advertises unlimited fries--the initial portion was small.  The burgers were cooked well.  More fries were asked for and when the three orders came, one order had ketchup on a fry--probably from the cook's hand while prepping burgers.  Then a second batch of fries were asked for and this time there was cheese on the paper separating the fires from the basket.  The probable reason for the materials on the served food.  Even though we arrived early, there seemed to be not enough staff.  My guess is the hurried staff was more worried about getting food out to the tables than making sure the food was served without condiments touching the food or the container that the food was served in.  Other nice restaurants in the area should be considered over this restaurant.More,Like everywhere-understaffed, but all  the staff  were literally running  their butts off to serve, and did  and  excellent job.  Grace was our server-very smily-helpful,  and although rushed asked frequently what we might need.  And several times she noticed what we needed  without asking and brought...it to us.  The whiskey bbq burger was excellent-fries good-and salad with meal was good.   We will be backMore,We knew we had a large party for my sons birthday so we called 2 days in advance to make sure they could take us.  The said we could but to call back the day of to reserve the space.  We called back at 1100...am( opening time) to reserve the space for 1230 as suggested by the staff.  We arrive at 1200 only to be told we had to wait like everyone else, 30 - 60 minutes.  When we explained that we called ahead we were told ""we don't do that"" by the host.  Even though it is written on their menu, listed on their website and suggested by the phone answering person.  The manager came and helped us get a space outside, fortunately it was a beautiful day, so we took it.  Sat right away and service was great for our large party.  Food was quick and good.  In short: manager (5 ð___)  server (5 ð___)  host staff (1ð___)More,We celebrated my granddaughters birthday at Red Robins.Staff sang Happy Birthday and the service was great.Not much of a burger person so I had the Avo-Cobb-O salad which was very good. And did I mention I love the campfire sauce!!!,Had an outstanding meal with family. Always get the Whiskey River burger and it was great as usual. Unlimited fries is a plus and washing it down with their bottomless freckled lemonade is a must. Service was spot on. Bathroom clean. Good times.,Our group had notified the restaurant that we'd be coming, yet they only provided us with one server. She was unfriendly, didn't check on refills, and kept change without asking. One person in our party didn't receive their salad until after they'd already finished their...burger.

The food itself was underwhelming. For a burger chain, the burgers weren't great. Unlikely to return to this (or possibly any) Red Robin.More,Great Burgers with healthier options too.  I got my chicken sandwich lettuce wrapped instead of in a bun and unlimited broccoli instead of unlimited fries.  We had a group of 8 and walked right in on a Saturday evening.  Got us in and out with...plenty of time before our movie.More,This was my first time at this restaurant chain. I am keto dieting and found that they had a lot of items on their list I could eat.They were also willing to substitute vegetables for fries at no extra charge. The meal was great  and...the price was reasonable.More,We took our granddaughter other favorite place to eat and here is where she chose.  This was an interesting experience.  The service was slow, but not due to our waiter but the place where they make shakes was behind.  The kids got their shakes half...way through the meal.  The salads were good, no one tried the burgers.  The appetizers were just a little greasy. Over all it ok.More,We were looking for a different burger experience.  RR filled the bill because the service and the food were very good.  I'm more of a fries person with the burger being the secondary.  RR keeps the fries coming and makes a good variety of burgers.,This particular store has always given us great service. My complaint is for all Red Robin restaurants. This is a hamburger specialty restaurant. The hamburgers are so obviously frozen. That takes away all the good things about the burgers for me. All the sauces, cheese,...onions, etc. put on them do not disguise the fact that the burger is frozen.  I can go to Steak & Shake and get a double cheeseburger for $4.00 and it is a freshly made burger and you can tell that it is. I can't believe Red Robin sells more burgers in a day than Steak & Shake.More,The burgers and sides are excellent! We always have great service as well! It's very family friendly and reasonably priced for the family.,Cold fries, spotty service, late refills, and apathetic management.  It's hard to find anything positive to say about our most recent visit to Red Robin of Edwardsville, IL.  It seems that this is the case about 50% of the time at this store.  Other RR's...in the area seem to be far better managed.
Tonight's poor Edwardsville experience pointed to an over-worked waitress, as we were just outside the door to the kitchen but could never find her or when we did see here, get her attention.  When we expressed our frustrations to the manager, she offered a discount on our check.  By that time, however, we were long ready to leave and anxious to advise others of what seems to be a far-too-often occurrence at RR Edwardsville.More,My family really loves this place. Lots of choices with good service and tasty burgers. The onion rings are the best! Will go again.,sat down never got served acked to order nerer got food so got up and left. we will not return and it was not bussy",It has a robot that serves your food sometimes and another one that rolls around the restaurant.,
"The robot delivers  your food. Prices are very high except for the over 55 menu. The service was wonderful.,I went here specifically for this.  Only to be sold by my server, ""We don't do that anymore"", when I presented my ID.  Well, guess what?  I travel 40-50 nights a year. (Retired...)   I used to go to Denny's quite a few times while traveling....Never again! 
 Thankfully, I carry some groceries when i travel.  The Denny's app is off of my phone.

Summation:  Don't even slow down to look.More,I always go here for their loaded veggie omelet. Food is always fresh and delicious, service is great and the restaurant is very clean,This is the type of restaurant you go to when you don't want to spend a lot of money but you want something very tasty for dinner. The service was very good with very polite and expedient wait staff,Good Food, Fast Service, Great Price! Busy Wednesday night. Arrived after Tour Bus and still were waited on to perfection. Remy apologized ahead of meal, because of Tour Group, Brought Drinks and Dinner rolls for while we waited. Dinner was served in less than 15...minutes. Family pleased plus great deal with AARP discount. Overall ***** 5 stars
 will be back. Highly Recommend.More,My wife and I ate lunch here once and breakfast 4 times, nine different meals.  We never had the same thing twice. Everything was great.,First morning back in the USA, and best breakfast in town for us.  As always, very friendly staff, and great food.,Always friendly service and consistently good food. We order from the 55+ menu plus get 15% discount for AARP. We absolutely love the grilled tilapia which comes with the fish, soup or salad, bread, and two sides for under $10 before the 15% discount. It's...not fancy but just a friendly atmosphere which contributes to my rating.More,We eat breakfast here when we are in Fairfax.  Best pancakes and breakfast foods.  Lunch and dinner are ok.,I have never had bad food at any Denny's and this location keeps up the good work. Good food, friendly people.,It'd been a long time since my last visit to a Denny's and nothing much has changed.  Same decor, same menu, same semi-running down aura.  All I got was a cup of coffee.  Fine, but nothing to write home about.  On the other hand: it...was quiet...they left me alone for over an hour, and the counter stool was comfortably cushioned.More,We stopped at this Dennyâ__s for a late night treat.   Our waitress could have not been any nicer. All we had was hot chocolate a pie, but she treated us like were having a full dinner.  It was clean and good service.,Try anything on the menu. I haven't found one item yet that wasen't very good or better. The All-You-Can eat pancakes for $4.00 is one of the best deals around. If you are AARP, bring your membership card along for a very good discount at...checkout. A good 55+ menu, as well.More,Standard breakfast for dinner one night out on our trip.  Restaurant was quiet, which worried us, but picked up soon after arriving. Everything you'd expect from a Denny's. Great service as well.,I stopped here right after a Dr. Appointment, so I was rather hungry. Ordered the cheddar eggs of the 55+ menu.  Came with scrambled cheddar cheese eggs, 2 pieces bacpn, 2 sausage and 2 pancakes.  Its typical Denny's.  The waitress, Alyssia, was working hard, and...was very polite.  The eggs were ok, as was the pancakes.  The bacon was ok, but the sausages were cold.  Not knock the frost off them cold, but almost fresh from the fridge cold.  Its denny's.More",The robot waiter was a fun experience and the wash basin in the men's toilets was clever.,
"We ate here a couple timesâ__paella and gazpacho were pricey but in line with other places in the area. We had a window view of the Rambla, so the atmosphere was pleasant.  House wine was decent and very reasonable.  Not gourmet, but pleasant staff and...a wide selection.  The convenience to the hotel was excellent.More,Overall the restaurant is good, food was very nice we even went back for a second night during our holiday. However those with allergies be very careful.. the second night for us nearly ended up with a trip to hospital. The menus have coloured dots...on to identify what allergens are in each dish, having an nut allergy myself I thought this would be really useful.. however when it comes to dessert on the second night then menu clearly stated there were only three allergens in all desserts none of which were nutsâ_¦ still we played it safe and went for a simple vanilla ice cream, when it came it was obvious there was something other than just ice cream in the bowl, another member of the party tasted to see what it was and it was in fact walnuts. When we alerted the manager he didnâ__t really seem to care, he was quite insistent that the menu stated this and even grabbed a menu to try and prove his point, then when he realised we were right he stated it was a mistake, no apology at all and a very â__oh well attitudeâ__ in a situation that could have killed me. It wouldnâ__t surprise me if he doesnâ__t change the menus and update the allergen information at all because he really didnâ__t care.
So those with allergies please be careful if you decide to go here!!More,Looking for somewhere close to our hotel, this place was ideal. Very busy, so I thought we were onto a winner !!!! Shown to a table just at the side of the bar and in front of the kitchen.Waiter arrived and took our order, food...and drinks arrived. So far, so good. When we had finished, the young waiter took our plates away. I thought it was customary, wherever you go, to ask if we wanted a dessert - nothing !!! We sat, we waited, still nothing !!!! We sat, we waited for the bill - still nothing. Finally we paid by the QR code on the table. The bonus to our experience was the Kitty Waiter, I loved her !!!!More,Nice location, easy to get there. Clean restaurant with a visible kitchen from the main area of the restaurant. Delicious patatas bravas spicy but not too much, even la paella de marisco was good but I bit overcooked. Pizza Margherita was thin, even tho, it...was decent. As a tradition, I had the sangria, unfortunately, the flavor wasn't very tasty. The staff was very friendly and helpful. It's also a modern restaurant where you can find a nice robot helping the waiters with the orders.More,Molt_­ssimes gr__cies, Ens alegra saber que vas gaudir, esperem veure't aviat!,Ordered the chicken Alfredo. This was quite literally the worst chicken Alfredo I ever had. It was tasteless dry and I wasn't able to finish my plate. My husband's paella was also lacking as it was very salty. We don't recommend eating here. It's very...commercialized being on les rambles, but other restaurants outside of les ramblas are likely better.More,Waleed and Salva were fantastic. We came here during a trip to Spain randomly and ended up celebrating my birthday with close family and friends. The servers were extremely friendly and went above and beyond to make me and party feel special.,Thank you so much!,We ordered some tapas, pasta and paella of course. That paella was complete disaster! And waiter asked for tip taking away almost full plate of unconsumed meal. Never nore La Poma!,Good service, attentive staff, didnâ__t rush us. Hand location on La Ramblas and fairly priced. Range of dishes. Xxxx.  Xx,Molt_­ssimes gr__cies!,Worst service ever , been there with family and waiters were not friendly and avoiding us 

Nobody wants to work here , not recommend for family,Terrible service along with mediocre food at best. Waiter was rude and clearly didnâ__t want to serve customers. Stay well away from here.,Waited over 40 minutes for an undercooked pizza. Completely blonde and doughy due to undercooking. Told the waiter to tell the chef (short order cook!) that the pizza was undercooked, which he said he would. Watched him and he said nothing!

High tourist turnover with...no commitment to quality! Blatant money grab!More,Beautiful atmosphere and ambiance, excellent service, quality food, good quantity, very pleasant service,More,Thank you very much for your review, 
We are very happy to know that you enjoyed your experience in our restaurant. 
We will continue working hard in order to keep offering quality products and the best service!
We hope to receive you again very soon....More,Just perfect! Tasty food, pleasant environment and excellent service. Additional points to the robot cat waiter, which brings the food to the tables, and real waiter called Khalid, who was so attentive and in such a great mood, despite the number of people being served....Really recommend!More,Thank you very much for your review, 
We are very happy to know that you enjoyed your experience in our restaurant. 
We will continue working hard in order to keep offering quality products and the best service!
We hope to receive you again very soon....More,Stopped for lunch from the hectic environment of Barcelona. Good pasta and lovely patatas. Also polite and friendly service from Khalid.More,Thank you very much for your review, 
We are very happy to know that you enjoyed your experience in our restaurant. 
We will continue working hard in order to keep offering quality products and the best service!
We hope to receive you again very soon....More,We entered the restaurant, and it took about 20minutes to order. We asked the waitress twice if we could order, but no one was interested in serving. 
We were about to leave, due non service, before a guy arrived at the table and asked for...our order. 
No smile, no apology for letting us wait so long.
The glasses we got was not cleaned well. 
Pizza dough was good, but the pizza was boring. I ordered the chicken bbq, and got about four small chicken bites.
Recommend to avoid this restaurant.More",It has a chef robot which dishes out the noodle dough.,
"This is a nationwide chain that specializes in factory-made, manufactured food. Food isn't bad but it is not good.  Palatable, inexpensive, great for families with children, those who want a quick meal. 

This location has a couple of  Cat Robot Waiters serving the patrons.  It...cries when it arrives, plays music to warn you that it is coming.  It cannot take plates back but will bring your order.  

Ording is 100 percent contactless.  You can use their app or their iPad.  Multiple languages are supported.

This location has parking onsite.More","I explained that the bill was barely 9 years old, but they are well trained robots and she continued to refuse, meekly.",
"was asked to place my order on the kisiok and no person attention,felt like i was in the Jetson of the future waited on my robots,bad smell around drink stations and backrooms filthy","The robot takes your food to your table, and it didn't crash even once.",
"I ordered through the Blake's Lotaburger ""New"" Robot System Sunday, May 9th, 2021!
When we got to the Blakes at 3201 Isleta Road SW, Albuquerque, NM 8105 around 2:00 pm, they were closed!! We ordered and Paid $70.00 for our family meal and no one...was there?? What kind of Show is this! Now, trying to get reimbursed from Blake's is a JOKE.  No one will take my call...More,Green chile burger with cheese in the south valley where they do it right.  I always get curly fries with it and their brownies are great too.,heard so much about this place but found it was nothing special. hamburgers okay the chilies help but was just disappointed.,I've eaten at Blakes dozens and dozens of times over the years.  They are quirky, individualistic, and nothing to do backflips over.  The service can be slow and you shouldn't be in rush at all.  The hamburger patties are thin.  On the upside, they cook...your hamburger right then and there (which is why it's slow) and if you get double meat, you can get a decent sized burger.  The fries are good.  They have Pepsi instead of Coke (and I prefer Coke).  When I'm not in a rush, Blakes is a decent enough stop.More",It has animatronic robots that sing and dance.,
"At the north end of the 2nd floor of the Convention Center, the Briggo Coffee Haus is robot coffee bar. Make your order and listen to it hum. I'm not sure if the TV screen actually shows your coffee being made (but I suppose it...does). The coffee was pretty decent. Human baristas have nothing to fear, Briggo is still slower than you.More"," A flaming robot followed the belly dancer, entertaining the whole family.",
"We arrived here on a Saturday just before mid day in a place which fortunately was not busy, so had a quiet meal free of screaming kids - how civilised!!!

As usual had my steak and shrimp mix fajitas and my other half donated his bean 'soup' to me so I could not finish my meal while he finished his massive dish with all kind of mixed stuff - men!...!!!

Great location, lovely atmosphere and a robot carrying food entertaining us - would have been great if he was dancing too: joking, of course.

We will be back.More"," The robot delivery system was also fun to watch. Robot serving food seemed to be a gimic which caused delays with customers getting food. The waiter was nice, and there was a robot serving the food which was pretty neat. The robot which delivers the food was also an unexpected delight!",
"In this place an order cannot be taken by any staff. You are directed to a machine with pushbuttons only. You must have a credit card also, or you cannot pay. This fast food facility has gone over the border to the unfriendly desert where...only robots and mashinery resides.

Do not ever go there If you are a  human!More", Just a robot DJ.,
"We were a group of 10 having dinner  to celebrate new year. The heater was not working and some of us had the jackets on all the time. Though the restaurant did not have that many tables occupied the service was average at best.I definitely...understand the issue getting servers, but they seemed to have enough to handle the 4 tables occupied. They charged us $50.00 to serve the cake we had got. When we asked to see the manager or the owner, he sneaked out and the server told us he left. 
I would not recommend this since there are several options available in the the same area.More,Deccan Spice has the worst service with excellent ambience. First the waiter explains you about the menu (as if we don't know to read and know about the Indian dishes). But fails to let us know that the charge of the water is $8 per...bottle. The cost of the water is not printed anywhere on the menu.  We order Chicken Pepper Fry but got Chicken with lost of diced onion. We order Railway Chicken Curry and found that it hardly had 4 small piece chicken. 

Don't waste your money here.More,An upscale Indian restaurant with a robot serving our food! If you are looking for nice authentic Indian food with amazing ambience and fine dining experience.  This is it !,Excellent addition to Edison Restaurants. Great ambiance, impressive once you step in, great lighting and layout.
Food is great and delicious - tantalizes your palate and presentation is beautiful - especially the lamb chops.
Drinks are well made and cocktails especially is a must try....Excellent personal attention and service.
One might say a little pricey, but the ambience, the drinks and the food give it a 5 star effect and look and offsets any doubts .
Great place to entertain with friends, family or even a date!.More,One of the worst food I ever tasted in last 10 years and it is so damn expensive. I was charged for water also and was told they don't have normal water. I ordered aloo tikki which was a frozen one with some toppings, saag...paneer was like green water and no real saag. Service was super pathetic, They never refilled my water glass even after asking 3-4 times. NEVER GOING AGAIN.
If you have money to waste to spoil your evening please feel free to go. The restaurants nearby are 10000 times, yes ten thousand time better and less expensive.More,Awesome place for rich ambience on Oaktree.
Been waiting for this kind of food and aroma for long time on Oaktree. Drinks are awesome. Its worth the money, you spend here. Quality time and Professional services require a high price. So Go for it, if...you want service, Quality food, ambience and quality time with your familyMore",The place itself did not have a lot to see or experience. Could have been a cafe anywhere that put up a toy robot or two.,
"It can't get more impersonal than the bland order taker and the robot girl that grabbed my debit card and shoved my food out the window before slamming the window shut, all without a single word of thanks, maybe come back, anything except back to...talking to their coworkers while the older looking manager type person was joking and laughing along with them.  I guess when this location is so busy they can be this way and don't think it matters. Does anyone care that these kids are not learning good life skills?  The food is decent, nothing above average.  They finally began letting customers know that the first window, which is all lit up and looks like the window at which to pay, actually is unattended and you can sit there for a long long time and no one will care except the car behind.More,After checking the web site and driving across town, was told that they were short staffed and closed early.,good for families 
alot  of kids  sports teams can get loud
one cashier and workers standing around messy",It had characters dressed as robots and an English woman which was a bad experience.,
"Managed get a half pass 1pm on a Sunday,  after a short wait, still very packed as one would expect.
It's huge corner restaurant, fully air-conditioning with a few tables on the side walk. 
Steamed Dim Sum as ordered, comes piping hot. The fried ones,...from the display cabinet was kept somewhat warmish or room temperature when served. Portions  relatively large, as did the prices had escalated, starting Dim Sum RM 6.50++, RM 7.00++ and RM 8.00++. Siew Loong pau RM 8.50++
Novelty of a few robots buzzing around, serving food and drinks. It slows and stops, as patrons walking by.More,Ordered the usual suspects to try first before getting more. The har gau and siu mai were okay, arrived steaming hot. The char siu buns were great so we ordered another one. For the non-steamed ones, most are already pre-cooked and placed inside a food...warmer. This works for some dishes but definitely not the deep fried ones like the ""wu kok"" aka deep fried yam dumplings. This dish arrived lukewarm and so wasn't very enjoyable. My brother who joined the table later wanted some wu kok and so I requested the waitress to bring us a freshly made hot batch, and thankfully she did. It tasted a whole lot better. I can understand the food warmer reasoning to ensure demand is met during rush hour but certain dishes must be made fresh to order.

To finish off we ordered some egg tarts. I found them tasty, not too sweet with crumbly pastry just how I like it. 

Most dishes are around $5.50 mark. We are not from around the area so not sure if there are other restaurants similar but I am told this is one of the better ones around with all day dumplings served til late night.More,Visited few times with friends and relatives as many wanted to have dim sum.
Personally I'd not choose to re visit as the foods are too salty! 
Not liking their char siew too.
I've informed the supervisor and hoping for improvement in future.,Restoran Jin Xuan Kota Kemuning Branch is one of the latest addition to this chain brand. The place is located at the corner lot (Opposite CIMB Bank). 

Classic dim sum like Char Siew Boa, Lo Mai Kai, Har Kaw and Siew Mai are must try...Dim Sum

Restoran is nicely renovated with many tables available and one of the nice and cleanest toilet in Kota Kemuning.More,The miment you ordered, it only took them less than 5 minutes before the dim sum is being serve. That beibg said, the dim sum is still tasty. Well, I would say it's hard to find good dim sum kowaday but this one is quite...a decent dim sum.More,It is a good dim sum place for the dim sum foodie. Has a decent range and reasonably well done. Service is prompt and friendly. Parking can be a challenge being in the heart of Kota Kemuning but where there is good food hungry stomachs...go. Cannot beat Ipoh dim sum but in case of dim sum emergency, this is the place to go.More,I was there with my friends for lunch recently. Faces the main road in the commercial centre of Kota Kemuning. Ordered the normal usual dim sum. Their specialty is siew yoke but was finished. So we ordered char siew which as tender and the black...sauce is heavenly. Their fish porridge is one of the best l have tasted. Good food n prices ar standard.More,Kota Kemuning doesn't really have many dim sum restaurants so this is one of the better ones. It probably doesn't compare with the best ones in the Klang Valley though. Prices are a little bit high for what's on offer. The noodles are especially overpriced.",Watch out for the robot waiter.,
"Everything we could have wanted from our visit.
The service from Sasa our waiter could not have done more for us. He was fast, efficient and very helpful in getting the meals we wanted for our grandchildren. 
The food was good as usual.
Will definitely...visit again.More,I had a great time here. We ordered the new tri formaggi leggara pizza, padana, and the buffalo mozarella, and tomato salad.  It was fresh and delicious. The afoggato dessert is a MUST TRY. Shout out to our waiter, Jack,  who was patient (as my...friend is extra as hell when ordering wine), funny and awesome. ILL BE BACK :)More,Excellent food and service, great atmosphere. Clean restaurant and toilets. Perfect location.

"Some foods were good - steamed and baked pork buns, steamed sponge care, taro balls, other items not so good - pan fried turnip cakes, pan fried vegetable rolls (taste was good, but way too greasy). shrimp dumplings weren't the best, shrimp was tough.,This used to be one of the go to places in Saskatoon but the last number of visits have been average for dim sum as well as take out.,This is a long comment but worth reading to the end. I had been a huge fan of Yip Hong on 8th street. After they moved to Stonebridge, It seemed like some of my favorite dishes didnâ__t taste as good. On one of my many...visits to Yip Hong, i was asked â__how was my meal?â__ I responded that that a couple of my favorite dishes didnâ__t taste as good. I asked if there was a change in the way they were making those food items. The owner said to me â__Youâ__re not a regularâ__ He pointed to an Asian man standing behind me and said, â__Heâ__s a regular!â__ He continued to repeat to me, â__Youâ__re not a regular.â__ I felt like he was being racist saying that, because I wasnâ__t Asian, how could i know how the food should taste. After all, I was not a regular. There was no apology for the poor food experience that I had. I didnâ__t expect a discount, i was just responding, honestly and based on my many past experiences, to how the food tasted that day.

I have never gone back to Yip Hong since that day and I never will. I wonâ__t give any of my money to a business that is soo rude and unapologetic, never mind, borderline,  racist!More,We had eaten there a few times before but today I was very disappointed with all the dishes which were all tasteless.  Given an example,  Chinese brocolli  (gai lan) came steamed or boiled without any sa tay just simply to dip in oyster sauce aside....The rest of dishes we ordered the same, tasteless. And they are pricey to compare with other dim sum in town. This would  be my last time going there.More,Know Chinese food from 50 years of eating and sometimes cooking it in Toronto and Vancouver as well as overseas.  We took a Chinese family to introduce them to Dim Sum, which is not traditional in their parts of China, and regretted having taken them...to this place. The dishes were more or less genuine but generally not very appetizing because they'd been overcooked or undercooked and prepared in a mediocre fashion.   Likely cooked from frozen.  This place does not deserve its reputation.  They used to have long line ups; no wonder they were only half full.More,With the caveat that Western-oriented dishes such as Singapore Noodles are sub-par, the dim sum is superb, and expertly freshly prepared with excellent ingredients. The experience is wonderful, whether you dine in, or have the food delivered.  You order via an app on your phone,...and then it is delivered to your table. So it is a bit less fun than if you order off carts, but since the food is fresh, who cares? The standards, eg shu mai and har gow,  are excellent, and there are also some excellent additions including their eggplant and scallops. In a strip mall of Circle Drive so the location isn't the best, but at least there is parking,  and it is easy to get to. Internationally competitive,  and a suggested destination...certainly more than a local restaurant. Good job!More,After going here 4 times Iâ__ve bit into 2 course hairs on 2 separate occasions. All I got in return was a new order which I didnâ__t eat because I was turned off and no apologies or discount.,Ordered for the first time. Was disappointed with the taste and quality as this is rated number one. Enjoyed the rice and sweet and sour ribs; however the duck hot pot, special chow main and vegetables with garlic sauce were meh. Probably wonâ__t order online...again. Possibly going into restaurant may be better?More,Sumptuous authentic chinese dishes! I love their dumplings, special fried rice, beef brisket and tendon and more! There are many choices from starters to desserts. They serve free jasmine tea! The owner os very friendly and accommodating! Place is busy at times that you have...to wait to be seated. Overall, I still recommend this place for family dine out placeMore,Absolutely love this place.  The food is amazing, let alone the experience of something other than a typical sit down restaurant in Saskatoon.  The staff were helpful and always available, I couldn't believe how busy this place gets, we made sure to get there early...for dim sum lunch.More,Arrived for a late lunch so missed the food carts, but were still able to order from a dim sum menu. The food was great plus excellent service. Since we were having late lunch it was quiet in the restaurant which made it nice for...visiting.More,Very authentic, everything tastes good, staff are friendly, even exceeded our expectation...cant wait to go back!,Fun experience with authentic Asian cuisine. Lots of food on dim sum plates or ordered dishes. Quality, fresh ingredients. Dim sum dishes were flavourful and filling.,Everything about this place is great unless you are looking for a nice quiet lunch. 

The service was good and quick and the dim sum offerings were varied and relatively authentic. 

The portion sizes were good so good value as well.,Nit a fan of Asian food but this blew my taste buds... wish I liked it more I would visit there every day...great service and amazing atmosphere.", There?_?s absolutely NOTHING attractive about this robotic service,
"Wings are so good I will no longer go anywhere else for my wings! Staff and food were great young lady worked so hard and was so polite thank you! 

Visit 9/9/2022 We will def be back come see them they wonâ__t disappoint,So we have tried this place a handful of times now . First let me say that the pizza and calzones / Strombolis are good , the Greek salad and Greek lemon chicken soup are both great . The rest is Sysco kitchen. Frozen hamburger...Patties, frozen chicken fingers , their chicken parm
Sandwich is made with frozen chicken finger s. Their gyro meat is frozen . Their jumbo wings are super small and came drowned in a salad dressing that was so salty we had to scrape/wipe it off  to eat .  Our bill was almost 60$ this last time and we ordered a 8pc chicken wing for 12.99$ , a gyro platter that came with a salad and fryâ__s for 13.99$ and a Greek burger platter that came with a salad and fryâ__s for 14.99$ (the burger was way over cooked , the bun was stale and crumbled when touched and was suppose to have feta and a Greek dressing with pickles onions tomato and lettuce) . Also they charge for any sauces on the side .More,The pizza is heavy. I mean physically heavy. The weight of 3-4 pizzas in one. A single slice was enough to make me and two friends exhausted greasy and very unhappy with our decision to eat here. We got two different pizzas from here and...they both qualify as the worst pizzas we have ever eaten. The ingredients lack all quality to ensure you get as much quantity as possible. If you want a triple portion of soup kitchen quality food per slice this is the place to go.More,Hello Brandon! We are really sorry you didnâ__t like our pizza, however, we use only fresh and high-quality ingredients every day that more than 12000 of our regular customers enjoy. But we understand that itâ__s not for everyone. We hope you find yourself a nice...More,After visiting the botanical gardens we wanted to explore more of Sarasota and wanted some Greek food. We found Eleniâ__s Pizza Works. Diana was our server and she was very cheery, hospitable, and prompt. We tried their hummus and the gyros platter. Very good portions,...pricing was appropriate, and a very family friendly environment. If weâ__re in the area againâ_¦ we will most certainly visit once again. Give them a try.More,We stopped here on a whim on our way ome before heading to the airport.  What a great choice! Our server Marina was fabulous and the pizza was great! My husband and teenage son said they could eat this every day!,we ate here everyday for two weeks, yummy food and super nice and helpful staff, highly recommend this place to eat pizza with friends ð___,Amazing food!!!!! Great service!!!!!  This was my first time here and I will surely be back!!!!  Plus bring others thank you Diana and Abby,This family run business is the best.  Everything on the menu is fantastic.  A great mix of Italian, American and Greek food.  The looks of the place from the outside, are very deceiving.  It is a small place set off the road in an industrial...area.  But don't let that stop you from coming inside.  The pizza is so good, I go now at least once a week and sometimes twice a week.  Fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection.  I heard a man behind me, eating a Gyro, complimenting the waitress on how delicious it was.  Very quaint and homey inside.  Welcoming.  Come as you are.More,Very friendly ,food is yummy, very family-oriented ,,great group ,of of all the staff very impressed
Gretta loved the ambience,As soon as I Entered this modern yet quaint establishment I was taken aback by the tantalizing aromas that remind me of warm and happy times, and although most pizza places have this one moment and only this one moment Elena's was different. Kaylas bubbly...and cheerful greetings qnd excellent service really exceeded my expectations you can tell she is passionate about what she does and loves to help when she can! Thank you Elena's for this fantastic experience 
P.s the water is quite refreshing!More,We were looking for something to eat not too far from SRQ airport and The Ringling, and saw the favorable reviews on Tripadvisor.  The menu looked like it had something for everyone and prices were reasonable.  Our party of four was a little apprehensive on...arrival as the neighbor was kind of gritty/industrial  and the outside of the building unimpressive. We debated on whether to stay, but decided to give it a try which was a good decision!

Diana was extremely helpful.  She answered our questions with enthusiasm, took our orders efficiently and accurately, and was assisted but a cute little robot in bringing our food to the table.

I ordered the Philly steak and cheese calzone.  It was excellent -- the best I've ever eaten.  The crust was fresh, light and baked to perfection.  The filling was generous and mouth watering.  The steak was lean, tender and gristle-free with just the right amount of cheese and onion.  The marinara sauce, served on the side to keep the calzone from being mushy, was a bit thin, but very tasty. 

The others in our party uniformly reported their pizzas and salads to be excellent.  Perfect crusts, generous toppings -- everyone was very pleased with their food.

The dining room is function -- plain and clean.  We were able to converse easily as it was reasonably quiet with no distracting TVs.  If you want a hopping scene or atmosphere -- this is not for you.  If you want good food, check it out!  We'll most certainly be back next time we pick someone up at the airport.More,Great food & amazing service!! Diverse menu as well & all 5 of us really loved everything we got. They also have a little robot that helps the servers deliver food when they are busy!,Absolutely delicious! The best spaghetti Iâ__ve had since we moved here. Diana was awesome, and we will def be back again!,Stopped in on a Thursday evening and the place was busy.  We ordered a large ""Pizza Works"" pizza that three of us could not finish it.  The pizza was excellent and there were plenty of toppings.  The waitress was extremely busy because she was waiting...tables, handling the walk-in and pick-up customers and answering the phone.  Despite being busy she did not rush while at our table and when we were ordering.  One additional highlight was the robot that she was using to deliver food to the tables.  Very enjoyable evening.  If going there after dark, it may be a little hard to find but well worth the effort.More,My 13yo son and I drove across town 30 minutes to check it out. Eleni's did not disappoint!!! The food was amazing, and Diana was a fantastic server. We had the antipasto salad with Greek dressing, margarita pizza, chicken Alfredo, and tiramisu. Everything was awesome....The tiramisu was amongst the best I ever ate. Highly recommend!!!More", robotic staff,
"From entering this restaurant it was just amazing from start to finish.
It is definitely a must do if you are in Shinjuku.
The food was amazing along with great presentation and lots of twists and turns through the whole experience. I wont give anything...away.
Dessert added an extra experience which was spectacular.
Next time im in Japan I will be visiting again I cant wait.More,I wrote the world's best haiku to commemorate our fantastic experience:

Ninja restaurant
Wagyu beef disappeared
As if ... by magic

Superb food. Superb private room. Superb close up magic. I mean ACTUAL magic!,Our meal was amazing, from the presentation of the food, to taste and the service we were given. We would fully recommend and definitely go again!,This place is awesome, looks great and the staff are super lovely. I would totally recommend for people to visit.,Delicious food and the best service. A great experience - highly recommend for anyone visiting Tokyo!,Wonderful food experience, we both had the Wagyu set menu, good drinks menu too! Lovely tricks and ninja magic throughout. 
Beautiful aesthetic within the private rooms, costumes of staff and overall flair of the building.,We were not sure what to expect from this restaurant so when we had limited engagement from wait staff during dinner we were not overly concerned. Our waiter did however explain the meals wonderfully and each were presented in a really interesting way. The ""entertainment""...started after dinner and before dessert which was loads of fun for all of us. Overall we found it a memorable experience but would probably not do it again given it was quite unique.More,An absolute must if you visiting Tokyo. We reserved online and chose our menus before hand. I had fish and my husband the wagyu omi beef.
The lunch began with the best waiter ever, funny and friendly who started our meal with a fire magic...trick. Then a starter and a magic box with smoke coming out of it. Truly magic.
Main courses were delicious, and were topped with a show and a lovely dessert. 
Truly worth it. :)More,So much fun being met by a ninja and a robot ninja!! The food was great! Highly recommend it! Also a fancy red toilet will entertain you for ages ...,A great experience for our familj! Food is excellent and the presentation was marvelous. Really recommend Ninja a Shinjuku for a great evening and experience!,Tried a theme restaurant for a splurge on the last day in Tokyo. Quite a fun idea. Quirky and surreal experience.,Once in a life time experience. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the definitely is a must do for themed restaurants in Shinjuku.,We had an amazing evening - great food and atmosphere, with amazing surprises: children especially enjoyed the way each meal was introduced and the ""ninja training"" with dessert.,Great experience, lovely rooms, friendly staff, lots of surprises, all round fantastic time. Try the Ninja beer.,Private dining rooms, outstanding food, attentive service, calming music and a  fun experience besides. We made reservations easily online and had fun. A little quirky showmanship enhanced and enlivened the perfect food.",The service has usually been relaxed and friendly but this time it was...almost robotic. Robotic wait person.,
"i have visitied many burgers places in naples, this is by far the best. actuaslly, i am pretty sure it is one of de best in the whole. plenty of staff secure great service as well.,We've been eating here regularly for the past year. The food quality is consistently good. Several waitresses know us now and take good care of us.,Really good burgers, beer & milkshakes. Locally owned. Friendly staff. Good decor. Vegetarian options.,We were in Naples killing time before a flight out of Fort Myers and decided to try Brooks Burgers...Holy COW was my burger amazing. I consider myself a burger expert, having tried burgers literally across the world (with an emphasis across the US especially) and...this was likely the best I've ever had. Between the bun, the juiciness and softness of the meat, the perfect cooking, and the outrageously good flavor, it is simply unrivaled. We also ordered a few hot dogs and a veggie burger which were also incredibly good. As far as the sides, the fries are also quite good, while the chips were only okay. Apart from the service, which was not ideal, this meal was simply insanely good. This is especially surprising as to look at it, I would almost consider this place a dive. If you are a burger person though, you MUST try Brooks burgers!More,Family-owned.  Great burgers, and menu comes with a lot of choices.  Dogs, shakes, chicken tenders and wings, lot of beers variety, wines, etc.  Friendly service.  Reasonable prices.  Some unusual items on menu too.  Parking on site.  We had a corn dog (huge) and a patty...melt.  Both their fries and house chips are delicious.  Highly recommended for couples, families, or anyone looking for this kind of casual atmosphere and food.More,Great burgers of all kinds! This a great local Naples favorite. Great to stop with friends and family, especially after a beach day. 
I love the turkey burgers.,We were told about this burger bar by a guy in the bar of our hotel. He said you wonâ__t get a better burger in Naples. 

We had to visitâ_¦. He was not wrong, great little place with a great menu with so many options....Then there is the beer wall. Try up to 30-40 different beers. Whatâ__s not to like. 

The food served was fantastic and tasted so good. My son had a milk shake and said itâ__s the best ones he ever had and heâ__s 16yrs old

We will return next time we are in the town without a doubtMore,Coming from a local who works right next door at La Fitness. We love it here. All my guys come in at least 2 times a week. Awesome burgers, great beer and even better customer service. Highly recommend.,Great service, atmosphere, and food! Loved the donut burger with baked beans and the beer tasting opportunity. It's a really unique place you won't regret visiting. So many choices, so little time! I'd love to go back one day.,Awesome. We appreciate the great review. I hope to see you there soon!! 
Sincerely
The Brooks Family.,Loved the beer wall, get as little or as much of each type of beer, get charged by the ounce
Autumn salad, pesto and goat cheese and chips are amazing,Thank you!! We are just starting to work out the kinks. Itâ__s all new!! We appreciate the review and hope to see you soon.  Sincerely Todd and Sandra Brooks,Burgers and wings were delicious! My husband loved the beer room, where you self serve beers on tap. He liked getting to try different kinds.,Awesome review! Thank you. It means a lot to our family!!,I've eaten a lot of burgers over the years, and this was among the best ever. The burger was perfectly cooked and delicious. The fries were fresh, hot and crispy. And the fried cheese curds with pepperoni was outstanding. I will definitely be returning on...my next trip to Naples!More,Thank you so much!!! We have working hard to do our best! It means a lot to our family!!!! 
Todd and Sandra Brooks,All around great burgers and service is friendly.  Great selection available.  You will not be disappointed.  We will definitely go back again.,Love 5 Stars!!! Thank you for your time and review!  Our family is grateful for your kind words.

Thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service will definitely go back thereMore,Thank you Malcolm. We take every review to heart. It helps us celebrate when we do good and get better when we mess up. Iâ__m glad you had a great experience. Weâ__ll get you a shake next time your In. Thank you from the Brooks...More,The hamburger selection is awesome. You can have burgers for the most adventurous to the more conservative. The sizes are great and you can turn any of them into a small burger if you donâ__t want to eat much or it is for a child....The stuffed onion rings were unusual and delicious. Would totally eat there again.More,Melissa thatâ__s awesome!! Thanks for sharing your time to review us. It means so much to our family. I hope we see ou again soon. 
Todd-Sandra and kids
Thank you", The cute robot served the food quickly.,
"Me and friend went there after seeing amazing ratings online. We ordered Chicken Dumplings, Crab and red
thai curry. The crab was smelly and stale. When complained to the server he kept quiet and didn't speak a word or did nothing about it. I myself...work in customer service field and we have so many things to assure the customer or replace the particular food item or at least acknowledge or apologize about it. My God we were so astonished to see him only clearing the plates and didn't say a single word. However we did praise about the dumplings and the red thai curry was very delicious and perfectly made. That time also he didn't say a word neither acknowledged it with his expression nor said a simple THANK YOU. we feel he isn't interested in his job and behaving like a robot at work. He needs to be trained properly. While leaving the place also he had an absurd expression on his place I said thank you from my side for the service and no response to it as well. Quiet weird staff I must say.More,Neat restaurant, medium sized with simple but elegant interiors. Food is authentic and the menu exhaustive. Will take a few visits to try their entire range. However what I tried was excellent. Recommended,Had a chance to have dinner with the family. Good place but somehow was not very satisfied with teh quality of the food.,It was yesterday that after seeing a Zomato rating eight of us decided to try out this restaurant. What a horrible experience. The order taker took 20 minutes to understand another 45 minutes to goof up the same and another half an hour to rectify....The food that we ordered was topped with human hair and the senior didnt have an answer to the same. The Thai green curry was green water served with vegetables. It was a lousy experienceMore,I was invited here for their food tasting event. Mamasan is the youngest Oriental restaurant in the city, located beside 6 Ballygunge Place.
If you are a fan of Oriental cuisine or want to experiment with some delicacies, this is the perfect place for you....You won't be dissapointed with anything you order.
I visited this place for a food tasting event. The soothing ambience, the top-notch food and the warm hospitality is all one can ask for. The owner of this place was always around to assist us and give us the detailing of the dishes we were having.
The place has a seating arrangement for around 50-60 persons.
Coming to the food we had,
For starters,
1. SPICY LEMON BURNT GARLIC SOUP - The soup had a mild flavor of lemon which gave a beautiful essence to it. Shredded chicken and veggies were used in the preparation of this.
2. MAMA'S DUMPLING CHICKEN - Dumplings are the Chinese name for Momo's. This dish contained thick dumplings with a chicken filling inside, panfried. These were so soft and once you have a bite you can relish the juicy chicken mixture that the dumpling was stuffed with. It was garnished with finely chopped coriander.
3. KOREAN KIMCHI SALAD - Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish made with fermented vegetables. The salad has lots of fibre and less carbs. Diced chicken, shrimps and the veggies are tossed in some sauces and plated over some cabbage leaves This is the ultimate solution for those who want to avoid carbs and still want to gorge into something delicious.
4. KOREAN CHICKEN WINGS - Juicy chicken wings tossed in sauce and garnished with spring onions. Soft and succulent pieces of chicken would melt in the mouth once you have bite.
5. KOREAN BULGOGI CHICKEN - This is a must try for spicy food lovers. Thinly shaved meat marinated in sweet and sour sauce and then pan-fried. The pieces are soft and tasted great with the spicy gravy.
After the plethora of Starters we headed to the main course. We had,
1. MAMAK NEW GORENG - This is Fried noodles tossed in sauce and contains lots of veggies. Small pieces of chicken and veggies are used in preparing this. Garnished with spring onions.
2. VIETNAMESE MUSHROOM RICE WITH RED CHILLIES - A wonderful blend of mushroom and rice. Chicken and eggs were used in this preparation with less vegetables and garnished with spring onions.
3. GENERAL TAO CHICKEN - A wonderful chicken gravy to complement all the above mentioned main course delicacies with minimal spices. It has a sweet essence and the medium sized chicken pieces are deep fried.
4. SOI 11 CHICKEN CURRY - This is a spicy preparation of chicken. Medium sized chicken pieces deep fried and cooked in a gravy with good amount of spices.
After gorging onto all these oriental delicacies we ended the dinner on a sweet note with
DARSHAN ICECREAM - Honey coated chips served with vanilla icecream was the best way to conclude our dinner.
Overall I would recommend this place to all Oriental cuisine lovers. I would like to mention that the waiters were very efficient. The were serving food to around 10 of us and constantly taking care to find out what else we wanted or what service was required. Besides they kept heating the dishes that had become cold now and then.
The food here is prepared with keeping hygienic as the topmost priority.More,Absolutely amazing food at very decent prices... The portion size was quite good and was adequate for 4ppl... Would definately recommend the Chinese, Thai and Korean dishes... The fried ice cream desert was very unique... Must visit. 
Only negative they don't serve Alcohol. But the...food makes up for it definately...More,Eat with style south east Asian quality food without getting a hole in your pocket at Mamasan

â_¢Come and experience Asian food like never before.â_¤ï¸_More,Good food and service. Loved the Sri Lankan curry. Located in a quaint South Kolkata locality. Interiors are simple but smart .,Loved the experience . Sri Lankan curry is a must try . I liked the fish Takrai and the Mama's decadence for dessert .,The rating in Zomato was 4.7, so decided to visit it. The place is bad. Lets start with the ambiance. Quite sad. The food was very bad. Had ordered Prawn Suimui. Honestly have not had worse suimui. It tasted like street food. Next order was...Chicken Kowsuay. The dish came as completely pre mixed. All the ones, I have had, the ingredients come separately, and I would mix it on table. Incidentally, there was no noodles in it. The last dish was Chicken Green Thai Curry. Only place, where one has to order Rice separately with Thai Curry. The Thai curry was best among the dishes, though stand alone rating would not be more than 2. There was also an order of Fresh Lime Soda. The drink smelled of Medicine, and I could not have it. However, even though told to them, they did not replace it and also charged fro it. The service was also very bad.More,The pedestrian quality of food offered here, and its sloppy presentation , makes me wonder how it gets the rave reviews it's been getting.

The so-called Kimchi salad proved that the chef probably never has seen or eaten genuine kimchi - it turned out to...be nothing but cabbage coated with some sauce.

The Asian barbecued chicken was burnt and then doused in barbecue sauce to cover up the mess.

As for the honey glazed pork, the less said about its weird taste and even more weird texture, the better.More,Inauguration of south Kolkata's newest oriental restaurant at Panditiya Road opposite Triangular Park.

â_¢ Chicken Fried Steak Sizzler -

Flattened chicken breast cooked in Worcestershire sauce & then chicken patty is fried on both sides. Now, on a nicely heated sizzler plate, lettuce leaf, roasted bell peppers, blanched broccoli, baby tomatoes are arranged on top of pilaf rice. Mushroom sauce is poured on fried chicken steak patty placed on the nicely arranged sizzler plate.

â_¢ Roasted Chilli Pork -

And don't worry; it would not leave a hole in your pocket!!!!More,Visited this place just after the Puja with many of my friends and this place has turned out to be one of the best fine dining restaurants serving delicious Asian cuisine I have ever been to in Kolkata. This place is totally a gem. It's...just few months old. Located at Ballygunge, few minutes walking from the ballygunge phari. Very easy to locate off the main road. I went there with my friends for a lunch and the food was so amazing. Firstly we tried their soup:
ð__¹Chicken spicy sour pepper : The soup was very delicious and sumptuous. It had shredded chicken in it. Also the consistency of the soup was perfect and tasted great.
We started off with the starters :
ð__¹Bangkok chill babycorn
ð__¹Drums of heaven
ð__¹Oriental barbequed chicken.
All the starters above were mind blowing taste
wise. Overall perfect. But the one I loved the most was barbeque chicken.

After thi we ordered few beverages :
ð__¹Lemon, ginger and Kafir lime spritzer: The best drink to lighten up and start your heavy meal with.
Totally refreshing.

Then we headed towards main course :
ð__¹Coriander and burnt garlic fried rice : This rice had all the right flavours. It went so well with the tausi fish. Was drooling over how good it tasted.
ð__¹Tsing hoi : It was so delicious as well.
ð__¹Tausi fish : The fish pieces were so soft and the gravy was so much delicious. Recommending this dish.
ð__¹Teriyaki pork : This was one of the best pork dishes I ever had. Highly recommended.
ð__¹Chili garlic noodles : It was very veryy spicy and taste wise bland. Not that great.
ð__¹Potatoes and American corn (veg) : This veg dish totally rocked. It was so delicious with perfect flavours and went so well with the fried rice. My veg friend totally loveddd this particular dish and so did I. Recommending this one to you guys as well.

Lastly we made space for trying out their famous dessert as well : ð__¹Darshaan with Ice-cream : This combination is so amazing and I love whenever I had this dessert. The Darshan was crisp and the ice-cream cubes tasted so freaking good along with the crispy Darshan. Loved it.

Overall I loved how this place turned out to be. Right from the interiors to the posh decor and the well maintained staffs.This Place was in my list from a very long time. And it was worth the wait. They deserve a 5star for everything.
Surely visiting again soon.
Goodluck to the teamMore,Asian cuisine in Bengal has been stereotyped into Chinese with a sprinkle of Japanese here & there. But Mamasan is here to break through that doldrum & serve it's patrons authentic Thai, Vietnamese, Korean & Malaysian treats. Located at Ballygunge Place, Kolkata, the restaurant has...established its identity as a proper Asian eatery with a trendy & minimalist decor painted with calm & soothing shades. Cultural influences are strongly evident at every nook & cranny of this joint. Well lit & comfortably spacious, Mamasan indeed has pulled all the stops here.
We ordered the following items.

ð__¹ Lemon, Ginger and Kaffir Lime Spritzer  
ð__¹ Osaka Train Stationâ__s Mushroom and Tofu soup 
ð__¹ Som Tam 
The legendary spicy Thai Papaya Salad acted as the perfect starter.
ð__¹ Mamaâ__s Dumplings Bowl (Chicken)
Delicious Dumplings made with ground chicken, shiitake mushrooms, grated ginger and garlic, fish sauce and other finer ingredients. This is then sealed into Dumplings and steamed to perfection. Highly recommend this one.
ð__¹ Takrai (Chicken)
Takrai is Thai for 'Lemongrass' and this dish did have a strong lemongrass flavour profile. The Chicken was marinated with lime juice & fish sauce and then fried to perfection. A great starter to pave the way to the main course.

ð__¹ Korean Bulgogi (Lamb)
The Bulgogi which stands for 'fire meat' has its roots in the northern region of the Korean Peninsula & is extremely popular in South Korea. Traditionally, Bulgogi uses thin slices of beef but Mamasan has revamped the recipe to accommodate lamb and the end result was even better. With a strong flavoured sauce and a sesame seed garniture, the Lamb Bulgogi is a must try here.
ð__¹ Hanoi's Black Pepper (Fish)
A traditional remake of the classical Vietnamese dish which uses fish fillet, fish sauce, lemongrass & black pepper. Do try this dish as this is one of the best the restaurant has to offer.
ð__¹ Korean Chili Chicken 
ð__¹ General Taoâ__s Favourite (Pork)
One of the most appealing dishes at this joint, General Tao's pork comprised of high quality pork meat & a strong flavoured sauce.
ð__¹ Crab Meat in Black Bean Sauce 
ð__¹ Chili Garlic Noodles (Chicken)
ð__¹ Coriander and Burnt Garlic Rice (Egg)

 ð__¹ Traditional Darshan with Vanilla Ice Cream
Honey glazed fried chips served below a slab of vanilla ice cream. 
 ð__¹ Mamaâ__s Chocolate Decadence 
 ð__¹ Chocolate Brownie Fried Ice Cream
An iconic dessert where Fried outer covering are made out of grated coconuts & garnished with Chocolate Sauce & sesame seeds.

Besides the excellent food, Mamasan also scored high points in the service department. With a well mannered staff at their beck & call, patrons will surely have a great time eating here. So don't miss out on the experience & do drop by here.More,A casual find on Zomato, situated in Ballygunge place turned out to be a delicious discovery. Simple ambience, courteous staff, and no waiting queues even on a weekend.
Food is highly recommended, especially the pan fried noodles! A must try.",The atmosphere is nice even have a robot that serves your food sometimes.,
"A delightful sushi restaurant - with friendly staff and cute decor. Kings Running Sushi used to be a restaurant with a conveyor belt running down the restaurant filled with a bunch of different sushi options. 

That gimmick has been replaced by a robot, which will...slowly roll through the restaurant until it arrives to your table with your food. This way the sushi is always freshly made unlike with the conveyor belt, where sushi would sit for a some time and become stale. 

You order with a tablet at your table - which is easy enough to use and order from.More,Had a terrible experience tonight with a downright awefull waiter by the buffet. Very unprofessional, very arrogant and very unpleasant. Her bad attitude was clear to all and if she could sho would have spat in someones (cold and mooshy) food. Will never set foot...in that restaurant again - and will never recommend it to anyone.
Like

PS Maybe this is the reason that the option to rate the restaurant on Trustpilot has been removed?More,Had the running sushi menu, plus the buffet downstairs. 

The sushi was NOT very varied, and we had to eat the same kinds again and again. 

The buffet downstairs was as expected - boring and traditional. 

We did not try the mongolian. 

The dessert /...icecream was crystalized and tasted wierd. 

So all in all a little disappointed.

The building itself was impressive.More,One of the better all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets with standard selection of good Sushi, Chinese food and Mongolian Barbeque. The Ice cream bar is the best selection so far - although expect quantity rather than quality in the latter. Great service and historic building and good...place to go for an outdoor strawl to digest all of that excessive calory intake.More,Always good ,all you can eat,service ok,it is a buffet,self service.
The price is fine have been there many times and will go back.,I regularly come here with my family to eat sushi. The restaurant is devided in 2. Bottom half is a traditional ""mongolian babercue"" style restaurant. Everything is fresh and the quality is fine.
In the upper half of the restaurant they however have running sushi....Quality is high, and the amount of fish, is not as great as in a dedicated sushi restaurant, however sufficiant. Everything is fresh and tastes nice.
It is also a great place to eat with children. Not because of toys they can play with, but because the running sushi part is very diverse. Plenty of fresh fruit, but also chicken nuggets etc, that the kids like. By now my kids love sushi, and wants to taste everything.
For 2 adults and 2 kids we spend just above 100 USD including one soda for each. This is however on their cheap days, from Sunday to Thursday. 
If you are a geniue sushi lover, and eat at all the best sushi restaurants this will most likely disappoint you, however for the price I find it perfectly fine.More,The food was good, with lots of different dishes. We were there with our kids, and we only payed 30kr for our daughter (she's 1 year old).
The building is fascinating, with view on the marina.,This restaurant is normally packed, so it's a good idea to reserve before going. There are two options, the conveyor belt sushi style, upstairs (which is what we had) and more Chinese-style buffet downstairs. Sushi, though not very challenging in ingredients and style, is excellent,...fresh, well tasting and abundant, even my kids that are not wild with raw fish, could find things they enjoyed and ate well, us adults were well fed and enjoyed it all. The bill for two adults and 2 small kids was around 170 dollars with drinks, a mid-price bill for any restaurant in Denmark.More,Kings Sushi if you can get to sit by the running sushi its great and its all you can eat. There are better options for Sushi, but the value for money here is good. If you want the Mongolian all you can eat they still...have a nice selection of sushis you can pick there and the price is cheaper then the running sushi.More,Never before have i been to a place in denmark where i left with a great smile and having a wonderful experience like this

The food, the staff, the prices, the location, i could go on and on, everything about this place is excellent, it...was my first time at the place and i didn't expect much as i always have been disappointed before, but now i know there is hope!

Being  a sushi place i wouldn't think of bringing my kids only because they are too young to enjoy it, but for friends, families with older kids (teens) etc, the place has it allMore,Friends and I looking for some decent Asian food in Svenborg dined at King's Sushi.
Located in a large building/house with a number of floors serving a wide variety of Japanese and Asian cuisine.
While the flavors are a little moderated for European tastes the...food was plentiful, widely varied and enjoyable.
We dined and enjoyed it greatlyMore,Excellent family restaurant on a nice location overlooking the harbour of Svendborg ! Upstairs they have a running sushi restaurant with warm and cold dishes, and downstairs all kind of chinese meals ! Big choice ! Clean restaurant and very friendly people serving you !...Possibility of take-away and on an ""all you can eat"" basis for very reasonable prices ! Nice terrace with seaview !More",This robotic server asked if I wanted another beer.,
"Kind of expensive for a sandwich shop but if it makes you crave it, then itâ__s probably worth it. 

My husband loves the Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket and loves it too. 

Takes longer than youâ__d expect so be prepared or order ahead. Downgraded the...rating to a 3 JUST for the wait alone.More,Iâ__ve been to several Firehouse Subs.. they are very consistent and far better than the other chain places.. parking can be tight at this location... they seem to need more employees at this location.. it was pretty slow getting the food out... but once we...got it... it was great... Firehouse is a little pricy.. but you get much better food than the cheaper places..More,Firehouse Subs has pretty good tasting subs. No doubt about it. I've ordered the Hero and have been impressed by it's heft and taste. I can't say anything negative about the food.

However, a restaurant is only as good as it's service and when it...comes to service, Firehouse Subs sucks the Big One.

As a person who works from home, I oftentimes need to order our so I can keep myself in the zone. Someone had told me about Ubereats, so I tried them. The first time I used them, I ordered a sub from Firehouse. Excellent first experience. However, that was both the first and last positive experience I had with them.

Two times in a row I have ordered what can only be considered the simplest of meals. A sandwich, a bag of chips and a drink. Three items. I know pine combs that can count that high. Unfortunately, some of the employees at Firehouse Subs haven't learned to count that high. Or perhaps they are millennials, whose Helicopter Parents weren't around to complement them every ten minutes that they are doing an incredible job bagging take out orders. Without the lack of constant encouragement, they got depressed and simply forgot to pack a bag of chips.

Or perhaps the Fireshouse Manager neglected to give them a certificate of appreciation and a $2.00 an hour raise after a week of part time work and they went off their Zoloft and forgot to pack a bag of chips because they were feeling sad.

Maybe, just maybe, they thought they were too good to work at a sandwich shop because, with their plump resume of abilities and their almost superhuman skill set, they should be running their own hedge fund. Honest to fing god. 

Two times in a row somebody couldn't handle the responsibility of putting a bag of chips in a bag? Here's a thought for consumption. Why doesn't somebody check the orders before they leave? Here's another one, and again it's free! Why doesn't the driver who is delivering the sandwiches, carry a box of chips with them so when there is a screw up like this, they can simply reach behind to the back seat and grab a bag of chips for the irate customer who thought that ordering a three items take out order never thought that an order of such simplicity could be screwed up. Not once, but twice! In a row even.

Unbelievable. This kind of stuff should not be happening. It's inexcusable. The person/people responsible for such ineptness should  be kicked to the curb. 

Maybe we do need more robots.More,in comparison to the others in this sandwich category. The standard places just don't compare with meat quality and combos. Staff is on task and place is tidy.,Never tried Firehouse before and I enjoyed the sub! Good taste with fast service. Good selection of subs to chose from. Also liked the drink size, a large is a large!,I have not been to this particular location, but have visited the one in Chino Hills, Ca.  The sandwiches are fresh and tasty.  Hot and cold sandwiches available and your choice of breads.  Cookies are good also.,The employees were friendly fast paced and asked questions if I missed anything. Also good with kids. The tables were clean a x organized,I walked in around 12:30 for lunch and it was packed; a good sign. Table turn over was fast because folks had to get back to work. Service was standard and as quick as expected considering the volume. 

I had the Firehouse steak and cheese....It was hot and fresh aaaannnddd pretty scrumptious. The mellow yet pungent flavor of the melted provolone cheese as it smothers the tantalizing juices from the saut_©ed sirloin steak makes for one divine marriage of flavors. Complimented by a crispy pickle spear and a bag of chips, the meal and visit was superb. Best to park facing the street in the target parking lot.More,I recently found Firehouse subs in Irvine and enjoyed it very much. I was in Orange and looking for a fast food place and saw this and wanted to see if my first visit to the other spot was a fluke or is Firehouse the...same at another location. It was just as goodMore,What a disappointment. A soggy bunch of meat on a bun was the result of my order not being followed by the disinterested server who steamed the meat and the put on the bun resulting in one of the worst sandwiches I've ever had -...couldn't even eat it was so wet from the steam and the bun fell apart it was so soggy. I would like m money back. What a waste.More,We get Firehouse may be once a year, it is such a treat to get to eat here. We love the Hook and Ladder. The service at this location was great. Everything was fresh and good.,My Mom and I had the steak and cheese sub with onions and peppers. It was toasted just right. 
And there are many historic photos of City of Orange firemen , including one of my Dad from about 1953.,We have tried at least 7 of the many sandwich combos
available so far and were happy with the quality, taste,
and value as well as the service and friendly workers.
    Each time we look at the fire station pictures and
samples of new or...antique gear we notice something
different and are interested in all of the detail.
    We noticed the attention given to each and every
customer by someone on the staff every time. We
    recommend you give this restaurant a try.More,The environment is very enjoyable from the decor to the smiling faces of the staff.  As you wait for your order look around at the mural and pictures on the walls.  The mural is beautiful depicting Old Town Orange in the past and fades into...the present day.  Really pretty!!  Old firefighter gear tastefully decorates the place.  I find it very happy with all the black, white & red colors and even a ceramic dalmation dog near the front door.  Several big screen televisions playing current sports games too.  Our group enjoys the smokehouse beef & cheddar brisket, chopped salad with meats and the meatball sub is a standard choice with our teenager as well.  The seasonal sandwiches are good too and they will make it for you out of season if they are able.  Customer service really stands out at this location.More","We also saw delivery robots bringing food over to the table which was quite cool and a first experience for me in Singapore. Instead of actually serving food personally,  meals arrived on a 'cat robot' - charming and fun for children but also a little sad when it was the most attentive waiter",
"The soba was interesting, but not among the best in Tokyo by a long shot. Of the Michelin star rated restaurant Iâ__ve eaten at, this is the only one which left me wondering why it got the rating - maybe itâ__s declined, as happens to...some restaurants after they get awards.

Separate from the food, the service was quite rude - the only interaction Iâ__ve ever had in Japan which Iâ__d call extremely rude.  We were pressured to eat faster after being seated for only 10 minutes (clock time, no exaggeration). My wife texted me a question, and the waiter came to tell me not to look at my phone. The waiter started coming by every 2 minutes while I was eating to tell us that other customers were waiting. The table next to us was empty. As we left, we saw a 3 person line. We were out 15 minutes after being seated, regretting we had entered.More,Perhaps the best soba I've had in Tokyo. I arrived ~5-6 minutes before opening and waited a little over an hour before I got my bowl of noodles. It definitely deserves its star. Just know what to expect of small ramen shops, especially as the...demand here is so high. Expect a long wait for a rather short experience and tons of people waiting behind you. If you want to take your time and enjoy precise service, go to a full-service restaurant.

Also note that you can only order one bowl of noodles and can't get more noodles - that was a slight annoyance, but understandable given the demand.More,Based on the great reviews of others, we made a point to visit this restaurant when we were in Tokyo.  Oh boy, were we disappointed! Big time. Broth was too way too salty.  There were two staff, one to cook, the other was to serve....The service staff was too rude. He has no patience. Be sure to select your noodles at the venting machine very quickly bcos heâ__ll tell you to hurry up. And you have to eat quickly bcos he will urge you to eat faster as there are other customers waiting for your seat. This place is not children friendly.  We have visited many places in japan and this place totally changed my mind about the generally very courteous Japanese.  Skip this place if you are not ready to be treated rudely.More,Listed on michelin guide for multiple years. The taste is very delicate and yet complex. Must order the egg, it is very delicious. Better go there early and queue as it only has 11 seats. Open Monday to Friday only.,Is it worth the sacrifice? The pain and mortification? I arrived at 10:30 and there were 12 people ahead of me. At 11 sharp they open. Some 10 people can eat at the same time, so I was out of the first round. Lucky that...the first round was all Japanese, and locals eat as fast as a bullet train. So I was called in a few minutes later to buy my ticket and seat myself at this tiny cubicle with two benches facing each other, where 8 other customers will be sitting as they wait. A bit awkward, facing complete strangers so close, as if you're in the back of a police van with unknown hooligans. By the way, the machine is easy to use, there is a sign on the wall in English with clear instructions and menu description. Choices are rather limited (the sign of a good ramen joint), so take my advice and have the shio ramen (salt-based) with aji-tama (the ramen egg). I did not have the shoyu, but a Hong Kong-based 4th-timer sitting next to me was having the shoyu for the first time and said that the shoyu smothers the flavour of the clams on the soup, that the salt-based is much superior. Gorgeous recipe, amazing ramen, lovely texture and combination of flavours. I could lick the bottom of that bowl, but it's quite too deep for my tongue. The service is incredibly impersonal. I never saw a single smile. The Soup Nazi in Fukuoka is like the Dalai Lama next to these guys. I'm sure robots would be more friendly - just like the ticket machine is. Anyway, the great dilemma is: is it worthwhile? I waited 45 minutes and it was by all means worthwhile to have this formidable ramen. So, if you want to have this formidable, michelin-star Hototogisu ramen, you will have to wait and you will not be disappointed. Now, do you need to wait that much always to get ANY formidable ramen, not necessarily aproved by a French publication, but maybe even better than this? Not at all.More,We read that this small restaurant had a Michelin Star and, as we were in the area, we decided to head to this place. There was a queue but we waited because we wanted to try their ramen. After over 30 minutes it was our...turn to get into the restaurant. There was a machine where you can buy your meal and get the ticket that later on you will hand to the waitress. We waited a few minutes more to let the other costumers finish their meal. The place has about 10 seats only so that is the reason for the waiting times. Once we sat we were served quick. I must admit that I had the best ramen I ever tried!!! The taste was so delicious!!! We chose the normal ramen. The price is very reasonable and cheap if you bear in mind that has a Michelin star and the quality of the ingredients. It was a super experience and a fabulous ramen that we will never forget. I strongly recommend this place.More,This famous soup is very simple. The primary tastes are salt and fresh scallions. That's it. The noodles are cooked perfectly, but the overall experience isn't special enough. There are no apps. There are no drinks. Only water and soup. The chefs are all business,...it isn't a welcoming experience where you can have a beer and enjoy meal time. There are 11 seats, if you're number 12 in line then you have to wait until the next cycle. When you are seated the soup comes quickly and you feel obliged to eat quickly and let the line keep moving.More,I got here about 30 minutes after open and it was about 1.5 hours for a wait for 1.  I got their most popular ramen and it was well worth the wait.  It was pretty quiet and no photos inside except of your ramen.  I...highly recommend it here and will make this a stopover every single time I come to Tokyo.More,Sometimes michelin stars aren't deserved.

My partner and I went at 14:10 to the usual queue of this place. At that moment we only had one other couple in front of us. Everything according to their rules, since the last entry is marked at 15:00....What was our surprise when a very badly faced young waiter left the restaurant at 14:45 to mark with his arm that the last to enter would be the couple that was in front of us.

Although it was a disappointment, I understand that they have the right to mark those who enter and those who do not (although they break their own rules).

The unacceptable came later, when helped by the Google translator to Japanese (since the waiter did not speak English) we wanted to ask if we could book for the night shift or otherwise at what time we should queue. His answer was to start shouting in Japanese, even pushing me physically as if I wanted to sneak into the restaurant. Something that had never happened in my life, much less in a Michelin-starred restaurant.

I'm sure the ramen would be excellent, but before it took a lot more to get a star. All of us have lowered the standards in restoration, but Michelin critics should not forget some basic keys, including a good customer service. 

Simply unpresentable, place to avoid.More,On my first day in Tokyo, I wanted ramen and saw that Konjiki Hototogisu had recently gotten a Michelin star. We were walking distance nearby and  the restaurant was just opening, so why not? It was about 15-20 minute wait when we arrived at 11am...which wasn't so bad. We finally sat and got our ramen, and it was really good. I've been to Japan before and have had some pretty stellar ramens, so I wasn't blown away by this one. I did get an extra ramen egg and that was excellent. But I thought back to a ramen I had in Osaka and was dreaming of that. Don't get me wrong, excellent ramen here, but personally in the future I'd skip the wait and go somewhere equally as good.More,I was there yesterday. A young man kept everything orderly with the line (the approximate wait was 30 minutes). I also needed change, which he happily obliged. You pay at a ticket vending machine, and then you're given a spot at a table and brought...your ramen.

The ramen was amazingly good. It the best I have ever had in my life. The 900 Yen cost converted to USD $8.55, which was a bargain for a Michelin star restaurant main entree.

I highly recommend this restaurant. Be sure to follow all of the posted rules, which are thankfully in both Japanese and English.More,I was told that the ramen was good. I went there with my wife. The first encounter was with its queuing system. The space that separates 3 rows of customers  is obviously designed for people that are not horizontally challenged. Once you clear the outside...queue, you are subject to yet another queue. After that, you have to buy ramen tickets from a vending machine. Comprehending the process of ordering requires a proficiency in Japanese that I sadly lack. 
Since we had been queuing for so long, we intended to try different ramen available, we purchased tickets for 3 bowls of ramen for 2 of us. Thereafter, we went to the inner queue. When it was my turn, the waiter uttered something in japanese, grabbed my 3 tickets and walked to the vending machine. He then returned the price of a bowl of ramen to us. In other words, he allowed only two bowls for 2 of us without accounting for our feelings on the matter. He did not ask which flavour we wanted a refund for and there was no sign saying we could order only one per pax. All other diners watched but no one dared to say anything. The atmosphere then was eerily silent. If you enjoy poor customer service and the experience of being treated as inferior, please by all means, be my guestMore,From the outside this small restaurant seems like all the others that line the streets of Tokyo, a modest storefront with a nicely written sign would lead you to believe this is just another ramen place, but the queue to get in was our giveaway...to know we arrived.

Once you get inside, the restaurant is not what you would expect, for a place of this calibur I imagined rows upon rows of happy customers face down in their bowls. But I was pleasantly surprised. A large wooden bar with probably 7-10 seats lines the kitchen where three chefs are busy at work combining flavors and straining noodles to make your bowl.__

While the ticket machine is less inviting than it could be, the prices are stunningly reasonable enough to load up your ramen with all your desired accoutrements, and once you get your piping hot bowl, you immediately know you will not leave hungry.

The flavours of the ramen shine through like any well made ramen should, the broth is packed with flavour - leading me to be wonderfully surprised that any liquid can taste as good as that. The fats in the broth swirl around your spoon as you go to take a sip, and when it finally touches your lips your whole body shudders at how good ramen can actually be.

I really could go on and on about how much I enjoyed their food, but you should really experience it for yourself. This is a place not to miss, and will not break the bank if you're tired of overspending on everything else. It's very understandable why this restaurant is Michelin rated, but shockingly well priced.

And the beer was cold.More,My wife and I made a special trip to this restaurant after having sampled the ramen at all three outlets in Singapore.  It is not easy to find, but we thought that the trip would be worthwhile. We were wrong.  The ramen, while tasty, was...nothing special.  In fact, the ramen at the Great World City outlet in Singapore is better.  We have been visiting Japan regularly for over a decade; in the last 12 months we have been thrice, including to ramen restaurants in Hokkaido, so we have some basis for comparison.

Worse, however, was the service.  The restaurant is small and there is a clear sign that customers should not linger.  We understood that clearly.  But the server came over and pointed out the sign before my wife had finished her meal.  This is totally unacceptable.  By Japanese standards it is shockingly rude.  This kind of behaviour brings dishonour to the restaurant. The owners should chastise the staff for this lapse of good manners.

In short, not worth the effort to get there, especially if customers are to be chased out before they finish their meals.More,We waited on line both inside and outside for about 40 minutes before we were served our bowl of Ramen.  This place is cramped and located down an alley.  The experience here is all about the amazing Ramen.  We had this meal the day after...going to Narasawa which is the #22 restaurant in the world.  We spent $900 there vs. $18 here.  If this Soba House was near my house I would probably eat there at least once a week.More",This restaurant uses robots to take you to your table and deliver food.,
"The atmosphere is trendy and fun, and even the novelty of the food delivery robots is fun.  Specialty cocktails are on the fruity side, but fun and good presentation.

The food however is mediocre, poorly executed.  The rest of my family was able to eat,...but I could not eat more than a few bites of my pad thai.  Waitress did not even ask about my full plate when she cleared it, did not check if everything was ok.  

Recommend passing on this one.More,The restaurant looks amazing! It's very modern and cosy.
The employees are very nice, including the little robot that brings the food to us.
The restaurant is in a good spot because it is located in the main street of Limerick.
It is an excellent...experience!More,This was recommended by hotel staff as a good place to try. Not too far to walk to from The Clayton Hotel. 
We booked online just to make sure and that was a simple thing to do. 
Menu does seem to be reduced a little...from the online photos however thereâ__s plenty of choices. The food was really good and spiced with just the right amount of heat. Portion size was perfect and it was very reasonable for the price.More,Food is so tasty and plenty.  Reasonable prices. Staff friendly and Robot serving our food was brilliant service.  Would highly recommend a visit.  Would definitely return again.,Have eaten here before and loved it, food, service, decor, it ticked all my boxes so I  was disappointed tonight, very limited menu, poorly cooked, fajitas were just plain wrap, no lettuce, no grated cheese, coffees sent back as it was cold, 2nd one was...as well! Such a shame as its a beautiful restaurantMore,Ate here last night for my birthday meal. Lovely food, lovely drinks. Staff were OK not overly friendly. Food was very tasty but portions way too small for nearly 20 euro a meal,Food was nice, atmosphere and interior in the restaurant was nice too. It was 4 of us and we all got different dishes, I had mussels in vine and garlic sauce for starter and that was really delicious, for the main course I had lamb...shank and that was bit over salty but meet was tender, one person in our group ordered steak medium well but actually got almost rare... Service were very interesting because there is actual robot who brings the food, staff were really young but they were really nice and polite. I would go back againMore,Two of us called into Marco Polo for Sunday lunch.
We started with glasses of RIESLING WINE.
For mains, I had the YANG PANG CHICKEN with FRIED NOODLES, and C had the CHICKEN AND GREEN PEAS with PAPPARDELLE.
For dessert, C had the 3 COMBINATION...OF ICE CREAM and I had a HOT CHOCOLATE.
The ambience in Marco Polo was  uplifting, the staff were helpful (as was the  Robot) and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal.
Till the next time in Marco Polo!More,Have been coming to Marco Polo for years, great spot for all occasions but unfortunately thereâ__s just not good vegan options. Thereâ__s no vegan option for starters other than the salad or bruschetta but they have to be without the cheese, same for main course....Also shocking that they donâ__t even have dairy free milk so canâ__t have tea or coffee at the end. No dessert options not even sorbet. I used to love this place but honestly with every other restaurant in the city having vegan options Iâ__m just not bothered coming here anymore. Such a shame because when I do change the food to suit my dietary requirements I enjoy it but having to order the same things and make the same changes after years itâ__s just an inconvenience coming here now. For should a trendy restaurant youâ__d expect them to keep up with the times.More,Best meal Iâ__ve had in a long, long time. Truly sensational. The muscles to start oh. my. days.
The service was incredible so fast and the young fella was sound and had a funny accent. 
Would recommend highly. 
The end.,I enjoyed my experience of this restaurant. The food was delicious but my boyfriends slow cooked lamb was freezing cold in the middle and had to be sent back,which has resulted in him being very sick. The manager just walks around looking angry and doesnt...seem to help the staff if they are under pressure. Overall a nice experience apart from undercooked foodMore,We are here recently and had a lovely experience. A good selection on the menu and very good value. Lovely staff.,The food and service was excellent. My beef feather blade was absolutely delicious! So tender and juicy. The restaurant was very busy and there was a good atmosphere. Looking forward to returning.,Went after my graduation with 6 family members, we pre booked or table. minute we walked in i knew it was gonna be great !! staff were very polite they gave us table options were would like to sit which was great.  we were seated...in a great booth very comfy. we ordered from the main menu. big variety  to choose from from Irish, Italian and Asian cuisine. To be fair we ordered across the menu from steaks, fajitas, burgers and pasta dishes all the food looked amazing. The family couldn't fault it at all. I had BBQ ribs than sweet chili chicken with rice + chips was very flavorful, great quality with generous portions. The serves were great very quick and the serves engaged in conversation which is rare these days added to the experience. also to note the place is so clean and follows strict covid-19 guidelines which was great and made us feel at rest. The place really has the wow factor. The cost is good too if it was any cheaper be afraid i was robbing them.  You just have to go.More,Such good value for such amazing food. 3 courses for â_¬26! Service was so quick and staff were really friendly. Would definitely return it was the nicest food Iâ__ve had in ages"," And then the service robot came to deliver the dishes. Yes, a service robot!

It's was good and the place seemed very clean.  The service was so-so. We had to run the server down a couple of times for...a refill and some mayo.  During these times, I'm very appreciative of how restaurants struggle with staff shortages and always give the server the benefit of doubt but we could see that our server was certainly not overworked - just disinterested.

"Restaurant hour says close at 10pm, walked there and it was closed at 8. Please update your hours so it doesnâ__t waste peoples time.,Busy, and very popular. Chefs are cooking within sight and food delivered by a robot waiter.  The food was very good. Would definitely return.,Excellent food & wine menu. We had duck menu, which was really tasty. Also the pork belly and dumplings exceeded expectations. The servive was also excellent.,The food was delicious and the service was really good. We had a table close to the bar, and that was a bit disturbing. Other parts of the restaurant seemed more cozy. But all in all, here you get value for the money.,This is such a nice  restaurant, fantastic food and the interior is really cozy. I have been here many times, both with my friends and family and with colleagues. Everyone is always satisfied with the food! Love it!!,Waipo's website and the decor were great. Unfortunately, the greeting was unwelcoming! We patiently stood on the wrong entrance (yes, that was our fault) but the staff who notice us didn't offer to help. Lack of table service! No one came to take orders and...the waiters appear rushed. The food was too salty. Personally I don't write bad reviews, because all the restaurants in __stermalm and S_¶dermalm have been amazing. In case if you are after good service and tasty food (not just eating salt) this is not the place.More,We managed to get in here on Saturday night, despite not having a booking.  We got lucky as the food was fabulous.  It was essentially Chinese Tapas which is a great concept, and it was all cooked beautifully.  The visit was made more enjoyable by...the robot and the clever wash basin in the men's toilets!  Definitely recommend this place.More,Went to Waipo in Moods for two reasons: the dumplings and the robot server.

The dumplings were very good, but ours came quite slow (first four dishes came after 30-40 mins; then when we were done, we waited another 15-20 for next dishes). I noticed...other tables had theirs not that long time. It must have been bad luck on our part.

Service is uneven, some are friendly and helpful, some are nonchalant. The robot seems friendlier than some of them. It was not clear where do guests wait to be seated. We were waiting in the entrance, apparently one needs to go near the bar to be seated (so people started to be concentrated there and the poor robot could not pass).  We had to ask for a new table napkin since one of our new ones is with soya stain. The friendly waiter replaced immediately. Toilets clean.More,Was a good restaurant for d_®ner. Service is Nice. We had two beers and two sischuan noodle soup (not to exp_©nsive approx 20euros) and it was delicious ! Funny thing: they have a small robot bringing food from th_© kitchen,We came here without a reservation one night hoping to try this place out and it was a miracle they had room for us! It was super busy but they managed to fit us in and the food was amazing. The dumplings were so good,...every dish on the tapa menu looked so good. Our server was amazing too, definitely recommend checking this place out, and I look forward to returning here!More,An amazing tasting menu. 8 dishes, pretty original, all very tasty. Favorite was the foie gras dish and wasabi prawn. Personally regretted taking the drink offer with it but it was very much a me problem. Staff was mostly really nice.,The food was amazing and the portions were really big - must try! The staff and service were also excellent and athmosphere. Nice location and worth every penny  :),We had our date here with the 8 curse dinner and drink package. It was delicious well composed. Pricing was on the high side but definitely worth it. Staff and service was also good, the fancy yet cozy ambiance is perfect for couples or friends.,I think this is just ok dim sum, not top-notch. I should try other places if you look for a good dim sum experience,My son and I went as we had fond memories of a visit a few years ago, and because we both love Asian food. We were especially out for dumplings.
The food was good, we had various dumplings (noted that there was none without mushroom...or prawn - would have liked one meat only/vegetarian without mushroom). They were very nice. We also are black cod, pork and tuna tacos. My son (11) LOVED the pork and we ordered it twice. I thought everything was very good but was missing that â__little somethingâ__ that would have made it outstanding.
I like that you order smaller dishes so you can try more. Service was great. Would potentially go back but think Miss Voon and Farang have the upper hand for now.More","The robot waiter was fun, but above all: this is a classic hot pot restaurant in which you can enjoy a typical Chinese hot pot.",

Lots of it. Replenished quickly and efficiently   
The sushi is made before your eyes. Lots of choices
There's a pasta bar.
 Dessert area, lots of choices there 
Less busy at lunch time , but still very popular,I was at the Legend yesterday for lunch. Everything was as usual. The quality and selection of food, service, ambience were all at the usual level. No complaints at all.

However there was no duck service. When I asked why the metre D told me...that they were having trouble procuring from their suppliers. Understandable. What I did not like was that they had kept the price the same as before therefore indirectly increasing the price.

I would have understood and been happy if they had replaced the duck with something else like a roast, but they did not do this. This was not appreciated. I expected better than this from the legend.More,This was an absolutely wonderful buffet.  Everything was fresh, hot and very flavourful.  In addition to the standard Asian fare, there was also Peking Duck and 1/2 lobster.  Staff were excellent too.  Will be sure to go back.,Goodmorning!
I went for buffet lunch today!
The first time after COVID-19!
Amazing!
Maybe better than before COVID-19!
The best buffet in Canada and I travel a lot!
Thank you for making it normal again!
Mike,Sadly I wasn't able to come here in over a year because of covid but I'm DEFINETELY looking forward to going after covid is over.,I really dont understand the negative comments about this place. It is real chinese food not canadian chinese food like you get at the Mandarin. No chicken balls here and it is a good thing. So many food stations. Food is tasty. Of course with...so much variety, you dont get the best quality. For exemple, the sushi is good but not as good as you would get at a sushi pace. The peking duck was very good. The roo is big and well decorated.More,Wide range of food selection. Value for Money. The desert varieties alone will overwhelm you. This is a good for Lunch / Dinner Buffet. We visited the place for Business Lunch with the Team.,I like this buffet better than any of the others I have tried in the GTA. The servings of Peking duck are generous. The small chunks of crab are very tasty. The sushi is good. Service is good. There is ample parking. I like pretty...well everything about the restaurant. Of its typeI rank it five stars.More,We ate here on a Friday evening while staying in Markham. The restaurant was right across from our hotel. 

This is the most authentic Chinese food we've ever had. The food was fresh and tasty with a very wide variety. Service was very good as...well. Staff was very friendly. 

There was a promo the night we were there. One child meal free per table. Was good for us as the process were a bit higher than we are used to.

Would dine here again.More,We went to Dragon Legend for my Birthday in December.  It was very nice as I like the decor i,e, red and asian.  Food was good and we did not have to line up.  There was Peking duck and the server was very friendly (unsual...for Chinese restaurant)   Also I was able to choose my seating. The kids had a great time.  I chose dim sum and sushi, although there were other stations grills etc. The desserts were regular buffet,  salad was limited.  The soup station was good as you can have either fish broth or chicken broth on which to build your soup,  choices of Barbeque pork and dumplings both if you like.  Also a chef robot which dishes out the noodle dough.(kids fun).  Lots of choices.  The price $26.95 per adult. (seniors 20 percent off)More,This is the 5th visit here but the first lunch buffet & the other couple's first time. Unbeknownst to us there was a Chinese event also going on here in the main dining room. The parking was a challenge, we ended up parking on the...street but not a big deal. The place was packed but the staff was up to the task. They were quick & courteous. Luckily we had made reservations so our table was ready. The food lines were busy but moved along well. As before the food was fresh, delicious with lots of choices. Our table server was attentive even with the place being packed. Well done. Our lunch lasted about 2hrs. Overall excellent. The other couple enjoyed it as well.More,Missing the ""all you can eat"" Chinese food restaurants where I live, I wanted to try something new that wasn't too far away.  WE picked this place by way of the internet. Seemed Ok on line.  Wow I could not believe how decorated it was....Big expense and a bit place.  Thinking we may be too late for the lunch buffet, it was packed!  Hard to navigate for the first time, you need to take a good look beore getting what you want.  I had a lot of good food and really took my time, small bits of this and that.  It was pretty good if your into this kind of think.  Maybe a bit expensive but that was one of the closest places for me. We went for lunch, I cant imagine what was different for dinner.More,Expensive but worth the price 
Quality food, very fresh
Grandkids love going to see the robot that cuts the noodles,Very fishy Buffett   You will smell fish as soon as you get to the door.   They donâ__t carry much in the way of Canadian Chinese food.  No chicken balls or fried rice other than salmon  fried rice,Lot of choices of food, in particular their desert table. Love their all-you-can-eat crab leg nights on Sat. Price is above average if compares to typical Chinese buffet but much lower than those in hotel restuarant.",Robots are great ???? love how you can order via the app. They should get...more robots and sack the humans.,

We love the robot too. :-),We enjoyed the wood fired pizzas, especially the vegetarian options. Our waitress was very attentive, we didn't have any waiting and drinks were served promptly. One thing we did notice was overly intoxicated people staggering in off the street to use toilets, creating a mess....Probably needs better front entrance monitoring. Would go back another time, just not a Sat night in Darling Harbour.More,Hello,
We're glad to hear that you enjoyed the pizzas and the service.
Unfortunately some things are out of our control, but we would love to welcome you back another time!
Have a great week.,We had looked forward to a nice relaxed dinner here with friends last Saturday and were very disappointed with both the service and food quality.
While the entree were very nice our mains were delivered by a robot and server just as we were finishing...the entrees. Entree plates had not been removed so mains were squeezed onto the table to remove the entree plates. No relaxed delay between entree and mains! 2 of us had the veal scallopini which was both tasteless and only slightly warm. It was difficult to attract the attention of servers during the evening for drink orders etc.
Overall a very disappointing experience and we left feeling the restaurant was only targeting tourist style patrons who are unlikely to return to the area. A real  churn and burn experience rather than a relaxed dining experience we were looking forward to. We wonâ__t be returning.More,Hi, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback.

Needs more traditional things on the menu.,Hi Kerry,
Thank you for giving us feedback.
We're glad to hear that you liked the venue and service.
Your comments in regards to the menu have been passed on to the management and kitchen.
Enjoy your evening!,About a year ago this restaurant was of reasonable standard but the recent visit was almost comical. There were waiters running off with meals, half cooked food to the extent that a patron at the next table marched up to the manager with her plate...to complain. They certainly don't know how to cook gluten free pasta. As my partner said - it was only the robot who knew what they were doing! The manager did try his best but to be honest we just wanted to be out of there. Won't be going back for a third visit that's for sure.More,Hi there,

Glad to hear you liked the wine list!
However we're disappointed to hear that the food wasn't up to standard, we're always looking to see what we can improve on thus will be in contact with the kitchen staff.

Kindest regards.,The older woman was our waitress and she looked so disinterested the whole time. The burrata was literally like 14 dollars and was a bland milky cheese on rocket lettuce, cherry tomatoes with incredibly salty shreds of bacon on top.

Not that good for the...price. Luckily I scored the reservation with first table, and even so, the discounted price (all food 50% off)  still felt like a rip off. The pasta, the pizza and the drinks were okay, but I would expect much better than just ""average"" food at the price point.

Please spend your well earned money somewhere nicer with higher quality food and sacrifice the view of darling harbor, its not worth it.More,Good evening,

Thank you for your honest review. 
We're disappointed to hear that our standards haven't been met and that your experience with us was below average. We will be in contact with the floor and kitchen staff to ensure a better experience.

"We stay at the Vdara at least 4 times a year and my wife loves the muffins and salads.  This caf_© is convenient because it is in the Vdara.  Prices are on the moderate side which is nice.,In our many prior stays at the wonderful Vdara we greatly enjoyed casual dining at the Market Cafe.  Itâ__s convenient and one of only 2 places to dine at Vdara.   It was a major disappointment on our recent trip. They have severely limited the food...choices and what is available isnâ__t appealing. The yogurt cup has almost no fruit and grossly overpriced - go the Aria for a far better yogurt cup and pastries.  Great food is available at surrounding hotels but this used to be a good option after a long day at conventions. It also used to be very very busy but now we seldom saw anyone there in the afternoon and evening.   A big miss for a great hotel.More,Best option for getting a quick coffee and a pastry or breakfast sandwich. Much faster than standing in line for Starbucksâ_¦.unless you want Starbucks.,We always stay at the Vdara so the Market Cafe is convenient for a quick snack.

The prices are high, but it's Vegas, you expect that. For the breakfast the prices are starting from $18...and go up. The food is normal, nothing fancy. Enough for the breakfast.More,Used a myvegas buy one get one free voucher for breakfast, but would be happy to pay full price. I had a very tasty salmon, cream cheese and dill open sandwich and hubby had the omelette with huge breakfast potatoes...the coffee was really good and...the waiting staff were very friendly,  attentive and generous with the refillsMore,The Market Cafe is in the lobby of the Vdara and is convenient for a quick breakfast.  Itâ__s pretty average food and good service.,Attending a week-long conference, and staying at the Vdara, so of course needing to get a quick bite at the hotel was essential.

I purchased a sandwich here twice, and was twice disappointed.
First time was a roast beef sandwich for $16 USD, it was...cold and the bread was soggy, the roast beef was not very tasty.
Second time, mostly returned because I had no time to go anywhere else, I bought a smoked salmon sandwich for $13 USD. Again, very cold, the bread  was soft and slightly soggy, and not a lot of salmon.

But mostly, during the lunch time, the staff were so dismissive. I only got an acknowledgement ,when I actually did not respond when asked how I wanted to pay. Only then did they actually look at me, no thank you, no hello.

Better cookies than most bakeries out there. Always fresh, chewy, and not too sweet!,Expensive but high quality. Nice for the kids too as they have animatronic robots that sing and dance.  My boyâ__s love to visit this store just to see those robots and sing along with them.,We had an amazing fruit platter at our little father's day celebration. Perfectly ripe fruit arranged beautifully. This is a great store and definitely worth a visit when in the area.,Went during quarantine. They had people feet apart and letting a few in at a time. They were NOT raising prices as many places were. They even had sales! They also gave plastic bags for free during this time. Very impressed. Only disappointment was the...day after we purchased asparagus they were already wilted!More,An amazing time as always. Cashier Elisa was very pleasant & very helpful with the new bagging system (No Plastic Bags) which is very annoying.,I love to shop here for the quality of Red meat this store has. The best in steaks, pork chops, ground beef and chicken ...,A favorite place to shop but doesnâ__t have everything.
Petting Zoo for kids, great hot food take out & take out buffet, liquor store, garden center & nice snack bar with outdoor picnic table seating.  
Best soft ice cream @ snack bar- like old style...thick custards IceCream. Great Bagels, fried Chicken, Coconut Shrimp, Bakery Items; huge Fresh Fish Dept & tender Delish Meats. 
We go very often.More,This review is for Stew Leonards grocery store in Yonkers ny. First off, the prices are higher then any other  supermarket in the area, We bought a wedge there, the roll was old when we ate it,after  we got home. [ we were hungry] Passed...by the salad bar and asked the spanish girl at the bar a question, ,she just looked at me and smiled, so I asked her a second question, and again she smiled, at least she had a good attitude, So we checked out, again the  spanish girl at checkout just smiled, Ok, I have no problem with that, but not 1 employee said, can I help you, or have a nice day, or Thank you. Question, how do you hire people that dont speak or understand english, and put them on the sales floor ? Will I be back, No I won't.More,We ordered regular and sweet potato latkes for my family's holiday party. They were crispy and fried to perfection. Stew Leonard's is an amazing market. Great customer service and high quality products.,Fresh food, excellent variety. Top notch fish, meat, bakery and prepared food departments. No complaints. They have a huge parking area. Adjacent liquor store. During warmer months they have outdoor well priced bbq. Always added new stuff. If you spent $100 you get a free...ice cream, their own brand which is yummy. Great Christmas ð__² during holiday and garden center in warming months. no matter how crowded they always have lots of staff to help and expedite check out process.

They do it right.More,Stew Leonardâ__s is the best grocery store ever! We moved from west Chester a few years ago and it is what I miss the most!"," It is very good, loved the idea of the robot pouring a glass of wine and the whole idea of it being delivered to your table.",
"Visited this restaurant on the recommendation of some people who had previously dined here. We had a party of 9 with 6 adults and 3 kids. Service was excellent and attentive with a good choice of menu including, lamb, chicken and Turkish cuisine. Reasonably priced...mid range restaurant in the centre of Kusadasi rear the castle.More,The atmosphere and service is second to none. Came here on our last night and was the best place we had eaten at. I have been coming to Turkey for 16 years and these were the best lamb chops Iâ__ve have ever had. I truly...mean every word. If we had found this gem on our first night we would have come every night. If you ever visit kusadasi do not miss this place.More,Excellent!

Food was lovely and staff even went out of there way to find a Camembert for a member of our party. There was 9 of us and no complaints from anyone! Definitely a must visit whilst in Kusadasi.,The best food in kusadasi.......Sam and Mehmet thankyou ."".
The food is amazing the steaks melt in your mouth,The staff is so nice, the food was so extremely delicious (we had mixed grill and Kofte) and we had the best Turkish coffee ever â_¤ï¸_,The food and wine and service are great here. 
Portions were huge but it was so tasty we could barely walk when we left.,Had a really nice visit at the restaurant in october. 4 course lunch and everything was really tasty and freshly made,The food is excellent and very reasonable prices. Staff are good fun too. Family friendly suitable for all ages. Very clean,The meal was lovely & the staff were very welcoming. We had complimentary garlic bread (the dips were unreal) and ate pizza & pasta. We each had a soft drink and were treated to complimentary apple crumble dessert too! So impressed at the freshness of...the food and amazed at the â_¬15 bill... even got a free fridge magnet! Very happy and hope to return one day.More,We are staying at the Palmin hotel and the food is very repetitive (we are here for 2 weeks) so have spoken to other guest about different restaurants in the town and someone mentioned the Castles restaurant so after a long day on the beach...we headed to our room to get ready.  We soon decided that we were going to eat out again and started looking up some of the restaurants we were told about. I messaged The castle on FB and asked if they offer a free taxi service from our hotel and they did and we arranged a time for collection. Taxi driver arrived and called the restaurant who sent someone to meet us and take us through the stownnto the restaurant. We tipped the taxi driver and made our way to the restaurant where we were greeted with smiling faced and a nice  restaurant with other families and couples who were already eating. We ordered drinks and looked through the large menu and we ordered the steak special each which came with a cheesy garlic bread starter. The waiter also suggested spring roll to share which we agreed to. Glad we only got one to share it was delicious but massive. Our mains came with chips rice and a small amount if veg. It was a lovely steak cooked to perfection. We struggled to eat it all and my other half ordered another drink. We were so stuffed we couldn't have eaten another mouthful. The waiters and owners were lovely really friendly and attentive. 
When asking for the bill we were also given complimentary shots of something (no idea what but it was nice) the bill came and we expected somewhere in the region of 350TL and was suprised when it said 259TL. Amazing food great hospitality and nice setting we will definitely be back before we go home.More,We was wery surpriced of the good food and service as we have walked past the Place for more than ten years! 
can strongly recommend a visit and the waitor was wery serviceminded :),Found by chance when wandering around the old town. Tucked away in the corner. Mehmet is a star running round keeping everyone served and topped up with drinks.
Alot of regular customers that go year after year recommend finding this place and they weren't wrong....A 3 course menu from 39-69 lira aswell as a varied menu.
Fantastic food and plentiful.
Well worth a visit we ate there 7 times in 2 weeks. Excellent.More,Great restaurant off the beaten track. Food was excellent and entertainment was great. A belly dancer followed by a flaming robot, the whole family was entertained.,Lovely ambience, great service, friendly staff. 3 course set menu very reasonably priced, great value for money. Complimentary home made garlic bread to start, with cream and spicy dip, then Greek salad and cheese pastry rolls, followed by mixed Sultan kebab in a delicious spicy,...tomatoey sauce and served with rice and chips. Very big portion, followed by apple crumble with ice cream. Then they give you a little gift to take home. Definitely worth a second visit!More,I have never really eaten in this restaurant before. Even though I've been going to Kusadasi for years. I went in this year four times. The food is fabulous great choice. Very reasonably priced. I will be back again."," You order through a robot (who speaks English and Japanese!) and, if you're lucky, you can sit...at one of the few tables that has a robot friend. Unfortunately, those ones only speak Japanese, but we still loved eating with a robot.",
"Thank you very much for nice service and experience at wagamama putney. 
My visit today 13.09. was lovely ,waitress Renata been helpful and friendly to me which made my stay unforgettable. She suprised me with edamame and nice dessert on the house good job guys....I'll be back for sure, 
Tom.More,you're ever so welcome, it's our absolute pleasure + we're really pleased you had such a lovely experience, thanks!,My firecracker which I often have is too hot.
I can't eat the chili and they probably use chili sauce.
Prawns ok but not big and juicy enough.
Have had worse.
Wine acceptable.
The bac choi and prawn lollipops are ok but they should give...more and have more of a choice.
Katsu is boring and like a curry gone wrong.
With a bit of effort Wagamama could be much better.
It's not terrible.
The food is edible.
Pity since it's popular.
Saying that it's the only.place in Putney where one can go.
Everywhere else in Putney is awfulMore,heya we are sorry to hear about this but thanks for the feedback would you mind getting in touch here: https://www.wagamama.com/contact-us so we can get all the details and get back to you about it from there please,Went with work colleagues for lunch to celebrate a birthday.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  There was no wait for the food which was very tasty and piping hot.  She even gave the birthday girl a complimentary pierce of cheesecake to take away....Would definitely recommend for a work day lunch.More,heya!! thanks so much for this + we are super pleased that we could offer you such a friendly + helpful service especially as it was such a special day! it'd be awesome to see you back again soon!,Excellent service from Brenda, food was great apart from the noodles in the ramen were stuck together so some of them were inedible (felt like they were uncooked). Always enjoy eating here, might avoid the ramen next time.More,thank you for this honest review! we're delighted to read that brenda + the team provided you with such excellent service! we're so sorry to hear your feedback about the ramen. we'll make sure to pass this onto the team. we hope to see you...More,We visited about 3pm, quite busy and noisy.  It did quieten before we left, I assume we got the tail end of the lunch diners. Staff very welcoming and helpful.  Food freshly prepared and hot.,thank you so much for this honest review. we're very sorry to hear that on this visit it was quite noisy! we're still happy to read that you found the team to be welcoming + helpful. we hope to see you again in the future!,I came into wagamama over the weekend with my boyfriend. The service was outstanding but a special mention to the manager georgia. I have an allergy & she was so helpful and kind, I felt in safe hands! Normally I feel quite embarrassed/ uncomfortable about...having an allergy but she made feel so at ease. Her knowledge was second to none. I canâ__t wait to come back already. Thanks wagamama Putney!More,thank you for this brilliant review! we're happy to read that the team provided you with such outstanding service. we hope to be able to welcome you back sooner rather than later! thanks again,This is our local restaurant and we go there very  often.  The food is always delicious so is my gin and tonic. Every time when me and my boyfriend enter the restaurant we  feel so welcome. I need to mansion Fernanda and Midru? they extremely...lovely to us! They always find time to check on us and say a good word. We just wanted to say a big thank you ! And we defo recommend Wagamama Putney !More,The lovely food was ruined by the terrible service we received. It was painfully obvious that the staff wanted to go home and we had cutlery and food thrown down on the table in front of us. Our ice cream was brought out to us...before our main course and then when we told them we wanted it after our main, the manager told us that she would bring new desserts later only to bring the same ones out again (bowls were frozen cold and banana katsu was soggy from sitting in the ice cream). Several of the servers were really stand-offish and we were basically ran out of the restaurant. (We arrived at 9.40 p.m, staff told us we could eat but had to put in our order within 20 minutes. Sign outside stated that they closed at 11pm which is why we went there at 9.40 p.m in the first place). I have been to wagamama before and always found the staff very friendly, however, this was my first visit to this particular branch and I won't be returning.  Although the food was nice (as per usual) I felt very uncomfortable because of the rushed and rude atmosphere created by most of the waiters.More,Visited for lunch, and was impressed by the steps in place to feel safe COVID wise. 

At the front door there were anti bacterial pumps, all staff were in face visors, and there were screens up between each group of guests. You are also over...a metre from all other guests. 

The food was lovely, we didn't have to wait long, service was quick, all felt very clean. 

We went during the government deal meals at the moment, so the price was great also. But even without that, it is never too expensive. 

Would return.More,Amazing food  tonight at putney wagamama. We was all so impressed with the service today, a particular mention to Georgia who looked after all of us so well!! We will all definitely be back!,Put simply, my daughter (who suffers from coeliac disease) ate here at a friendâ__s party and had her worst reaction to date. She basically spent the next 2 days being sick and was off her food for over a week. Seems there was confusion over...the food, but my daughter was unaware so just ate what she was given. Extreme lack of due care and diligence from the staff. Absolutely fuming.More,we are sorry to hear this. can you please use the link below to get in contact with someone so they can look into this for you 

https://www.wagamama.com/contact-us,My first experience of Wagamama was very good. We were promptly seated, given adequate time to settle and look over menu and given the chance to order. The menu has definitely got something for everyone. The vegan menu is fantastic! Lovely!,we are so glad that you enjoyed your first visit with us! thank you very much for the amazing review! we hope this is the first visit of many!,As a fan of Wagamama, we visited Wagamama Putney High Street in June 2019, while on a family holiday.
The air conditioning was out of action so we probably should have quit at the start. There was no alternative put in place by the management...for example, portable air conditioning or just simply fans. The windows to the high street were open to allow some air to circulate, but the downside was the traffic fumes, especially the bus fumes that were coming in. The food, including the portion size (especially dessert) didn't appear to be the same as other Wagamama restaurants we visited, however the food itself was good. Our waiter, possibly the restaurant manager but certainly someone senior, was unfriendly and borderline rude. All in all a poor experience which we won't be in a hurry to repeat.More,we are sorry to hear about this visit. if you would like to discuss this visit further please use the link below so someone can look into this for you 

https://www.wagamama.com/contact-us,Me and my sister came for food, it was so amazing. The food was absolutely tantalising and the staff were very lovely. Great atmosphere would definitely come again !!!,we love to hear that you had such a great time with us! thank you so much for the amazing review. we can't wait to see you again,Amazing for families and the best vegan menu Iâ__ve ever seen. On top of that the food is so very very good, the staff are attentive and it is mostly very healthy too. 

Fresh tasting food which is also delicious, this might not be fine...dining but when I come back to the UK and have the choice of lunch this is top of my list. As it does when I have lunch with the family.More,hello there, thanks for taking the time to leave your review + 5 star rating with us. it's fantastic to know you find our vegan menu to be the best, we couldn't agree more! we are thrilled you found our food to be good +...More","Service was excellent and we love the Moz robot that delivers the food. See you again soon! Also, they have this little robot that delivers food, it was the coolest thing I?_?ve ever seen.",
"we waited 2 hours for our meal last night and were told they don't have enough cooks and sushi chefs to accommodate customers, we we told them they should tell customers - they argued with us - they just don't have the staff. The woman...who said she was the owner gave no apologies for the poor service. Very Sad since we WERE good customers.More,The food is always wonderful. Itâ__s too bad that this local friendly sushi restaurant is so expensive we can only go there once a year if even in their service is not even subpar. 
Two of the items we ordered were incorrect we had to...wait and wait and wait for someone to come by the table. 
$200 for two people give me a break. We had one cocktail eachMore,Best sushi we have had in a long time!  Happy hour is unbelievable. We are aficionados ready for a repeat performance!,A minimal interior with a nice bar and sushi bar all work well with very comfortable table spacing and a fantastic sushi menu.  We had several orders of uni, also some flounder not too often found on menus and especially in Colorado, and also some...local bass.  Everything we had was very good, presentation excellent, and with superb service.  We also had an outstanding sake which is on tap at the bar.  It's a bit expensive but we considered it well worth it and enjoyed our experience.More,We have enjoyed Sato for many years. The sushi is always excellent. They regularly update the menu and have several interesting apps and entreeâ__s. Always good service.,Sato has been around a long time in several locations. But it is consistently excellent. There are cooked alternatives for non-sushi eaters, but the sushi variety and quality are consistently some of the best Iâ__ve had anywhere. So, for sushi, five stars!,One of two or three best Sushi restaurants in the valley. Very fresh fish, all the favorites and creative entrees as well.,We went with sushi eaters and one that does not like anything not cooked. We were exceptionally happy and he had the Asian ribs that were meaty and some of the best he has had. Everyone was happy.,We have eaten at Sato several times before when in Vail/Edwards area and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.  Last night we were in the mood for Soto; they came through again. We didnâ__t have sushi or sit at bar.  However, the guy at the bar looked...fun as he was dancing away to the great music and making sushi.  My sister and I had the Shrimp Tempura from the appetizer menu, one order per person and it was the best Tempura I have ever had.  Scrumptious. It was beautiful, lightly battered, fresh, with shrimp and a wonderful variety of vegetables.   My husband really enjoyed the Pad Thai noodles.  We all canâ__t wait to go back for more of their incredible entrees or to sit at the bar and watch the â__entertainerâ__, the sushi chef.More,We have enjoyed this restaurant for a long time. Service is always friendly and quick. Food is always delicious. If you like Sushi then this is the place to visit. You will not be disappointed.,By far the best sushi you can get outside of the pricey joints in Vail.  The flavors and creativity are top notch.  Love the dumpling appetizer too and wish they offered the broth they sit in as a soup.  It is on the pricey side...but worth it.More,Sushi was great as usual! The Service not so hot. I have eaten here several times a year and the service never gets any better with the exception of one Waitress and I haven't seen her since that one time.....,Our party of 5 went to Sato on March 30th at about 7:15 pm. The restaurant was full, but  there wasn't a line out the door. We ordered some appetizers and sushi for our main course. The sushi arrived at our table about 1 hour...after we placed the order. Our waitress walked by our table several times and we finally had to ask her about the status of our order. Her reply was ""we're really busy"" and it sounded more indifferent, than concerned. You go to a restaurant because you are hungry and expect to receive your food in a reasonable amount of time. If the kitchen was really backed up, I believe that the waitress should have communicated that to us when we placed our order, and we may have decided to go elsewhere instead of waiting 1 hour for our sushi.More,I've been 3 times.  The sushi is hit and miss.  Perhaps its a different chef or just not as fresh sometimes but it can be poor quality and made me ill.

the setting is nice, the restaurant is great and the staff very nice.  I...believe in a small, highly competitive area, you need more consistency, higher quality and need to push the boundaries.  I dont think Sato is trying..More,A group of us went to Sato based on a recommendation and were glad we did. The pad thai, although a bit spicy, was delicious and the coconut shrimp sushi was dynamite!  Highly recommend this dish. Will return when in Beaver Creek again.","More,Good restaurant they have very delicious food and sweet was wooww we really enjoyed.friendly staff special thanks to all the team  and thanks for the robot ????????More,Dear Valued Customers, We would like to thank you for expressing your opinion concerning your visit to Gusto",
"The soup looked like dishwater compared to the menu photo, with awful rotten veggies used. Was it because we ordered takeaway...did you think you'd get away with serving bad food?! See photos of their grey broccoli vs freshly steamed and photo of rotten mushrooms,We managed to win our indoor netball final by 12 points and chose to dine at lemongrass to celebrate winning our indoor netball final by 12 points. My meal was massive so I got a take away container (lunch tomorrow I suppose hehe). Ben got...a funny mayonnaise style chicken number (47) it was fun.More,Thanks so much for the feedback. Congratulations for your win.,Coeliac diner loved his meals of grilled beef salad plus Thai chicken red curry. Both meals were hot with a perfect amount of spice.
The robot delivery system was also fun to watch.,Thanks for the feedback.,Prepare for a large wait to be  asked for drinks   One lady next to me asked 3 times for a drink. 

Seemed to be customers complaining at every table

Not sure in the Asian fusion theme.  As i had been served Beef  on raw vegetables...Robot serving food seemed to be a gimic which caused delays with customers getting food. 

Even had trouble paying for the meal

Staff  looked  like they needed training on basicsMore,We came as a group of 10 but the quality of service provided was unprofessional. They didn't deliver 2 starters & 2 mains where when we asked for the starters they only bought out 1 if the missing starters. They tried to blame us for...not getting our starters by says we should have told them after 2 mins.

Basic customer service such as checking the table has anything was not provided. We only had 1 drink order offered in the 2 plus hours there. Even had the audacity to blame the lack of staff as if this was our fault.

Better training for staff plus employing more staff would improve the situation. In saying that the food we did get was not too bad tastingMore,Went there last night, first day of holiday and this was the only place available in Blenheim as everywhere else was booked.. the menu is gigantic and incredibly confusing. Indian/Thai/Japanese/Vietnamese and so on.. we had 3 dishes, the very angry duck was actually really nice...but it came on basically a bed of raw cabbage and carrots cut into shapes. The shortribs were very sweet, and came out barely warm. We also had a Vietnamese pancake, this was not traditional at all.. filling very disappointing. We ordered a side of coconut rice which came out quite soupy and incredibly sweet, we didnâ__t even eat it. The waiter was nice, and there was a robot serving the food which was pretty neat. Overall, would not go there again as the food was disappointing.More,I had the crispy chicken green curry and my partner the ginger crispy pork and we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The robot which delivers the food was also an unexpected delight! Also pretty impressed with the wait time for food considering the place was...packed and we had to wait for a table to be cleared to fit us in. Would eat here again.More,Thanks so much for the feedback.,Purchased takeaways at the start of the dinner service. Ordered online through their website and arrived a few minutes before the requested collection time. The staff member on the counter was unfriendly and stared awkwardly at the till for about a minute before asking me...to take a seat and said it would be a few minutes. 
She came out later with the order and once again was unfriendly. Got the order back to the hotel to find that the rice was not the requested and paid for premium garlic rice.
The food was mid to high priced, well cooked but not as spicy as expected for their highest spice level. Overall a very mixed reaction to the service and food.More,Firstly when we ordered the prices looked quite reasonable on their menu, but there was a catch, another $15 was added for GST on top of the menu price shown and then more was added for delivery.
We were not happy that the GST was...not shown in the initial menu list or at least clearly highlighted GST was to be added afterwards.  It made the meal very expensive and we would not have ordered all of the dishes had we known.
Otherwise the food was nice and flavoursome.More,Visited with friends last night after a recommendation. Also read reviews that this was good for vegans/vegetarians. However had a very mixed and disapponting experience which was a shame as it could have been really nice.

Good points:
My eggplant red curry was delicious! Friends...enjoyed their food. Good portions, polite service.

Bad points : drinks were slow, came out after food. Never received the sides that we ordered so had to tell the person at the cash register so it was taken off our bill.
Main point was when ordering I asked for our meals to be vegan (partner and I were sharing), as I even specified dairy and egg free just to make sure. Partners meal arrived, we both tried some and ate egg in it. Very disappointing and would even say I was upset by this, as there is a reason I am vegan.
Staff apologised and gave us a new meal without egg, which was good.
It wasn't busy either, only about 4 tables, so disappointing experience. However would try again because I think it could be lovely. Hope that management can review this and it won't happen to another person.More,Had a lovely dinner on a cold night. Food couldn't have been better.  Staff very friendly and attentive. Can't express how good this was. Try it and enjoy.,Not impressed any more, our last two visits have been very disappointing. Pad Thai was bland and over noodled , I had Chrispy Duck which wasn't crispy and was over done with tamarind. This used to be our favorite restaurant but seems too have lost...its flare lately. So time to support somewhere elseMore,Hi Mark,

Thank you for taking the time to review our restaurant. I am sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your experience. I will pass your comments on to the Chefs to fix it in the future. 

Thanks

Operations Manager 
Lemongrass.,Had a lovely meal with friends on a recent visit to Blenheim. The service was good but could have been a bit more personalised. The food was tasty and hot but not amazing.,We had a delicious meal served quickly, waiting staff very friendly and helpful in advising of the spice content of the food. Thoroughly enjoyed our evening meal.,Takeaways and it would be kind to say 'awful'.
Been to the Richmond outlet before and more than happy so assumed Blenheim would be the same.  Wrong!
The fired rice dish, prawns, was very badly cooked.  Actually debatable whether it was cooked.  Big blobs of...rice balls and the prawns - appallingly poor value.  $6 over the chicken option for 5 pathetically small  prawns.
The other two dishes, both chicken, were just as bad.  God knows what oil they use to cook but Thai it isn't - some oily glutinous mess.
Only reason it got one 1 was that 0 is not an option.          

Avoid, Avoid and if your vaguely sensible avoid!More","It has robots that brings your food and drinks and the service is friendly. The place looks good and they have a service robot, which is cute.",
"I was a little shocked at how busy this place was. However, the took great care in showing me how everything worked and the have English menus. The staff were kind and courteous. The sushi was great and you certainly can't beat the price! Overall,...this was a great experience and one that really makes a trip to Tokyo complete.More,I went about half 2 on a weekday. No queue. Instruction menu in English. Most dishes 100Yen. Order on the iPad and it arrives on sushi train in front of you. Very clever technology.,If you are from out of town and come in the evening for dinner, you can expect to wait for a long time before getting seated. It was over an hour and a half for us.

Another problem is that this place is situated in...an office building and there isn't any other restaurants around to go to in case you decided not to wait. You will have to walk towards the Shinagawa station where there's tons of dinning options, but that's at least a 10 minute walk.

And yes, the price is relatively inexpensive, but you are only getting what you paid for.More,Pro: cheap sushi
Con: cheap sushi

Cheap and cheerful, this place seems to always have a wait time. (Waited 45min at 7pm on a weekday.  Line got longer as we waited) Conveyor belt sushi with most sushi plates _¥100. Simple hot items such as curry,...tempura, miso soup also available by ordering on a tablet. Best thing I ate was a standard size chawanmushi with a couple of quarter-ized scallops in it. Deliciously smooth and tasty for _¥180.  We thought it was an okay meal, but this is Japan - there are much better meals out there! Good for tight budgets, otherwise skip this place.More,We can eat delicious Sushi.
There are many foods. 
The first, Sushi is delicious,cheap,fast.
Second,Udon,potato,ice cream.
They are very delicious.
I want you to go to KuraSushi.,Excellent, inexpensive, restaurant for sushi, tempura, etc.  Visited with a colleague on a business trip for dinner.  Staff was very accommodating for English speakers and helped us with the entire process.  Excellent quality sushi and many options.,This restaurant always looks busy due to the foyer area having patrons getting takeaway and those waiting for a seat. We did our touch screen booking for seating and found the procedure fairly straightforward even in Japanese. Plates are 100Y for most items.There is the...train with food and if you need other plates,order on the touch screen at you seat and it will arrive on the conveyor belt above. Place you used plates in the slot and it does the counting for you. Most drinks are via the screen also and there is a fridge with some alcoholic drinks near the toilet door entry. We had a fun night and tried many things we haven't eaten before. Our wait time was 10 minutes but it can be longer I understand.More,The sushi is not the best but this place is loads of fun and great cost performance. The sushi rice rends to be too sweet but most kids like it that way. In addition to the plates going around on the conveyer, you can order...on the screen at your table and the dish will come street to you on a separate ""express"" conveyer. Every five plates you deposit in to the slot, the slot machine will start and the winner get a little gift. Everything is pretty much automated here. Loads of menu items available for non sushi eaters.More,This sushi restaurant was something special! You either can take plates off the conveyor belt running beside the tables or order them (as well as drinks, specials and desserts) at a touch screen display. Every plate from the conveyor belt is 100_¥, some special dishes...are above. 

The food was delicious, the even had some special salmon sushi with cheese topping I have never eaten anywhere before.

To get rid of you used plates, you can put them in a hole in your table. For every fifth plate you can play a minigame on the touch screen where you will sometimes receive a small gift. We have never seen anything like that before in a restaurant and really liked it.More,We have been here for several times and visited this sushi shop again on 25 Oct.  We were accustomed to the procedures in getting the queue ticket from the auto-machine inside the shop as well as ordering the dishes from individual computers from our own...desks after sit-in.  The auto-delivery system was really amazing and the records you have ordered were shown clearly on the screen.  The sushi dishes were really value for money, more or less at 100 yen per dish and most important of all, there are no added sugar to the food.  All in all, this sushi shop is highly recommended despite that you have to wait for at least half an hour for your turn.More,We waited about 45 minutes.

You press the blue button on the screen to get a table at the counter.  The number below it is the waiting time.  

We ate 8 plates each and it cost about _£14 in total.

You need to read the...thing in front of you when you sit down if you don't know what you're doing like us.  

To make the tea you get the green powder from the thing and put it in your cup amd add water.

You can order stuff from the screen and it appears in front of you or you can pick stuff up off the conveyor

It was good.More,Great place. The food was fresh and tasty. The concept is simple and works perfectly. This is not a fancy resto but its a great night iut for fast and delicios Sushi. Beer through auto nachine was good.  We enjoyed our selves very much. Highly...reccomendMore,First noticed this place on Google Maps looking for directions to our hotel. Then my wife and I looked up reviews right here on TripAdvisor and decided we had to try it. One good piece of information was that if you donâ__t have a reservation,...how to request seating. When you enter, straight ahead is an electronic kiosk that is all in Japanese. Tap the blue box on the right and select the number of people in your party. It will print a ticket with a number. Just wait and listen for your number to be called. Since we donâ__t speak any Japanese, we just sat with our number facing out and the host was able to wave us over when our number was being called. The staff is very helpful! They did not speak any English but this did not hamper the service or experience at all. Once our group was called, we were given two clipboards with numbers on them. The numbers corresponded to our seating assignment. Numbers are on the backs of chairs, again, super easy. Once you sit down, there is an instruction card in Japanese and English! There is also an electronic touch screen above your table area that has a language option so you can change it to English. After this, ordering was easy. Just tap what you want and order. Hope these instructions help you with getting set up.

There are instructions with how to make green tea and you can order other drinks from the touch screen. There is also a conveyor belt that you can take food from. The instructions are confusing and I learned the hard way how to pop the plastic cover up in order to take your food. Grab the plate firmly with your thumb and index finger and raise/tilt the entire plate up. This will open the lid so you can take the plate out. Do not try to open the plastic lid like I did, it will not pop open. Food that you order will come from an elevated conveyor belt after a notification flashes in your screen. Be alert, they come fast! Lastly, at the ends of the tables are stations where you can grab beer.

When you finish your plates you can slide them down the little shoot in your area. The computer keeps track in order to bill you correctly. There is a button to call staff at any time and the food is amazing. Truly great sushi that comes out fast! I ate about 11 plates of various sushi including red-tail, tuna, tempura, etc. All delicious. I used the beer machine which is coin operated so it wasnâ__t included in my bill. Altogether we had 14 plates, soup, 3 iced green teas and the bill was _¥2,408 ($21.58) which is an amazing deal!!! I still canâ__t believe how cheap it was and might go back later today. Definitely highly recommend. I read in other reviews that it can get crowded but we didnâ__t wait long at all and there are a lot of locals who eat fast so they are in and out. Enjoy!More,So this restaurant is a bit hard to find, but super worth it. 

There will likely always be a wait. Here's how to get your reservation ticket: 
-Walk up to the machine (which is only in Japanese)
-Click the blue button to the right
-Select...the number of people in your party
-Select whatever the option is that comes next
-Prints out a ticket with a number on it -- this is the number that they call 
-Also, it might be helpful to google how to pronounce the number you are given in Japanese 
-That being said, after they call a number and no one responds, they typically find the people that don't speak Japanese and manually check your ticket for the number 

Because we came late at night, we only had to wait for 20-30 minutes. Also, the main conveyor belt was emptying out and we had 100% of our food ordered from the tablet. 

Sounds weird, but definitely make sure to order the chicken tempura sushi. It's lite a delicious chicken mcnugget on rice. I also really liked the green tea shaved ice.More,Always people waiting for seats n we had to wait to get our seats around 40 min.
But it worth it!!
Great for value!! Kids also loved it.
If you love sushi with reasonable price you must go."," The robot brought the drinks, rolls, and delivered the food.",
"The quality of the eat in is by far superior to the take away. 
On this visit our take away cod and chips was extremely dry  and tasteless. 
It is very disappointing when we know it can be so much better.More,I am sorry to hear of your bad experience in Barracuda. its a shame you did not let me know personally so I could have felt with the matter straight away. 
please come in again and have a word with us about the matter and...More,Have ordered and eaten in shop . Always been happy with meals ordered . Today the fish was lovely chips were hard and mushy peas disgusting,Wow wow wow! On behalf of 1st Upminster Brownies, we would like to say a huge thank you to Catherine for her generosity in sponsoring the amazing chips for our chip walk this evening. No less than 27 portions of chips on the house! We...were really humbled and grateful for the generosity and cannot thank you enough. The girls said the chips were delicious, hot and crunchy! Just how chips should be! Thanks once again, and we look forward to visiting you with our families!More,It really was our pleasure. 
great to see kids enjoying themselves and honestly it was a joy!,Most of the time sitting in is superior to the take away. Unfortunately I was disappointed as there was very Little Rock in the batter. The waiter gave us _£4 off the bill. 
Disappointed.,A huge thank you to this fab establishment!  We were let down last minute by our caterers and Barracuda had no problem supplying us with 40 very hot fish and chips beautifully boxed with pickles all cut and supplied with serviettes and forks. Also bottles...of vinegar and salt packets supplied on time as requested!  All of our guests commented on the quality of the food.  A huge thank you ð___  we would highly recommend.  Faultless.More,A BIG Thank You to Barracudaâ__s in Upminster for their generosity tonight when 2nd Cranham cubs all had chips to take away.  We all thoroughly enjoyed the delicious fresh hot chips and had 20 full happy bellies.,Popped in as couldnâ__t be bothered to cook and always like this place.
We had a couple of battered sausages, cod, large chips and couldnâ__t fault it. 
The portions were more than enough and was fresh and piping hot. 
The staff are friendly and the...prices as expected. 
They also have a restaurant which must be worth a try.More,My partner and I sat down to eat the other day. 
We ordered the grilled wing of skate with Chilli and spring onion garnish and the Greek salad. And it was amazing. The fish was large and had a real heft to it. The salad...tasted fresh and the feta practically melts in your mouth.
Was really good and will definitely be our regular date night spot from now on. 

Compared to other chip shops it is on the pricey side but Iâ__m a genuine believer that you get what you pay for. We wanted quality and thatâ__s what got. 

Thank you for the good for and service. You will
Deffo see us again soon.More,Must be the smallest 'large' portion of chips ð___ I've ever purchased. I bought took them to take home. They cost _£4. I thought the bag felt a bit light when the woman handed them over, but I thought it may just seem like that....But when I got them home my suspicion was confirmed. No more than two handfuls. About 2 of those _£1 cones which are often sold at seasides like Bournemouth. Absolute rip off. I wont go in this shop ever again. On top of this the people are not that friendly. Perhaps they don't think they have to make an effort. Well they do. With their service & their product. I love chips. In future, I'll go elsewhere. Their selfishness & unfriendly nature has lost them a potential long term customer. I'll still get my chips from another shop so I wont be losing a thing. This shop will never see my money again. Ever.More,I am sorry that you had such a bad experience at Barracuda and that the staff seemed unfriendly. 
We strive to be the best we can be. Its awful to hear that we were selfish as well as unfriendly. 
I recommend speaking with managment to...More,Used to love eating in, or getting a takeaway from here. Had a takeaway today, and cant believe how much it's gone down hill. Bland and tasteless. Disappointing, wont be returning. Far better options locally.,Dear Mark 
I am sorry to hear you are disappointed in your order.
If only you had spoken to a member of staff we would have been more than happy to put right something that is wrong.,Only a take-away but living away from Essex where you can't get rock eel, this was truly excellent. Will come again next time in the area.,Sadly felt the need to add this review as the owners are exploiting their customers. _£16.50 for cod and chips and a cup of tea with no menu offered and trying to justify the cost by saying theyâ__re only offering large cod, seems dubious. Really...disappointed, everything is cooked well and non-greasy but only someone for whom cost is no relevance should bother visiting here.More,unfortunately this was during Covid and we threw our menus away and had a board up instead indicating the prices.
After 4.30pm we no longer serve the lunch menu that is a smaller fish.
our price is not out of line with other fish and...More,I will never go there again.  We went lunch time. First gripe a bottle of white wine _£25.
There was six adults and two children. We only had fish and chips and the bill came to _£140.  Couple of beers, oranges for the children and...a couple of cokes, I had a glass of water.  What has happened to the place it used to be excellent. There was no menus. The board telling what you could order had no prices.  It used to be the best.More,Shambolic service , no menus ??

Poor chaotic service , small portions ( even though asked for large fish)  small skate and chips _£16  small cod and chips _£12 !!!!!!  No menus to hid hiked prices during eat out to help out scheme !!!!", There was a creepy robot serving the plates and food which was terrifying.,
"Ogaâ__s Cantina was everything I expected. From the bar snacks and the ALL the Drinks that we tried it was an experience.  As far as making reservations three month in advance to saving money to spend at The Disneyland Resort and Star Wars Park. We...made sure to read all the fine prints and read all the reviews. Disneyland is a very busy themed park you know that reservations are required unless you want to wait for an available table or standing room only.    Take the time to download the Disneyland App and for your food reservations  use the app STAKEOUT.  Use this for all you Disneyland resort reservations.More,This is undeniably a cool place, a fantastic concept.. but that is where it ends, it is a concept.

BOOKING:  We tried for 6 months to get an online reservation, no joy, checking almost every day... When we turned up at the park, they were...allowing people to enter before 11.00, we queued for less than 10 minutes and we were in!! 

The bar is amazing, just like the film... however it is PACKED... people everywhere.  If you book a table, that does not mean your table, it means you share a table space with as many people as they cram on to it.

The worst part is the drinks.... On the menu and online, they look like hand crafted cocktails that are presented with style and elan... NOPE, these are prebatched draft cocktails (in the main) poured in to a tumbler and served.  They looked horrific.  Not even a garnish, nothing just bright liquid in a bad glass..

That would be almost ok, if they tasted ok, but they dont... they are overly alcoholic with no balance of fruit, sweetness etc.. they were really, really bad drinks... 

Servers dont care... I think most people just think a super strong alcoholic taste is great value... of our 5 drinks, we did not finish 3 of them... 

Really bad... 

I would say miss it, but it is a bucket list place to visit... 

Disney, sort it out... get the menu built correctly and make it the experience you promise, not the crap you deliver.More,Very disappointed. We had a reservation for 8. For starters, we were sat at a dirty table. Next, we were sat with another party (of 3 people). The final straw was this party of three appeared very intoxicated. They were severed 3 drinks in the...time it took us get one drink. They were also cussing and being intrusive. Rather than enjoy a fun experience with my kids (all under age 10) for a reservation for our party. We left early due to the conditions of the table, the other party sitting there, and how uncomfortable and disappointed we were.More,If youâ__ve been there once, that was enough.  Drinks are super expensive and reservations almost impossible to get, that means you can get in but have to stand because only those with a reservation are seated.  It looks great online but in reality itâ__s a...small room decorated in the War Stars theme which will take less than a minute to see.  There were 6 of us, 4 had alcoholic drinks 2 just juice drinks and the bill was $90+ And we didnâ__t order any snacks.   No Star Wars characters were in the bar while we were there only the staff. This is basically a bar so donâ__t plan on eating here.  None  of us said they would go back again.More,Was at Oga's Sun Feb 27 @ 1pm, very tall black gentleman/server sat us at one of the community tables, which I knew they had & is normally not a problem.....BUT, the 4 people already seated there were asked to slide down so our group...of 4 could share & they REFUSED to move. So we had 1 person on a stool and the other 3 squeezed together with my son's rear hanging halfway off the bench. Not sure if all the tables are community, but if not WAIT FOR ONE or just stand somewhere. Very uncomfortable. We ordered a cheese plate & the girl was literally breathing on it she was so close. They took down the plastic dividers, which were NICE. To top it off, the table was absolutely FILTHY. Such a terrible experience. Icing on the cake- no coasters given to us, which are normally nice souvenirs and none of the drinks had the toppings they normally have (cereal bits, etc.). Very very bad. Oh yeah, & we were celebrating a b-day & the check in gal knew that. Wow! Won't be going back for a LONG TIME, maybe never.More,Wow. We were SO excited about this place.  Imagined we'd see the musician characters and little touches of weirdness throughout.    What an immense immense immense disappointment.    

Yes- cool detail in the ceiling and upper shelves. But, no characters-- just a robot DJ.   very little authentic...atmosphere.

Service fine.  Drinks ok.  Prices utterly insane to the point of being offensive.

So disappointing.More,Absolutely a waste of time and money. You are packed like sardines. Literally hot and humid from too many people. A COVID SOUP. We were sat at a booth split in half with plexiglass. This is a cocktail bar with children, even infants. A small...child of about five was next to us and would not stop touching me and banging on the glass. This was a singularly horrible experience. Drinks are premixed and way too weak when a mucus encrusted child is rubbing their hands on your physical body. Disgusting. We could not leave fast enough.More,We had so much fun at Oga's Cantina.  We had our 14 year old with us and we were lucky enough to get a booth.  We ordered the only 2 food options on the menu as a little snack and then we each ordered 2...extremely over-priced but fun drinks.  I love the Fuzzy Tauntaun.

We enjoyed the atmosphere, the music and the refreshment.  Our waiter was very much in character which also made it pretty fun.  Looking forward to experiencing it in Florida this summer.More,Either make a reservation online 60 days before your visit or plan on waiting ina club style line hoping and pleading to get in.  Food is a joke, more expensive thana fine dining establishment for next to nothing.  Prepare to stand if you haven't reserved...one of the very few tables.  Drinks are crazy expensive and offer little to no alcohol.  I got a blue vodka drink that was mainly a sports drink, supper tiny, all ice and zero vodka.  The gin drink my husband got is the only way to go, but still very sweet with very little gin.  Service is subpar and there are much better places in downtown Disney to pay much less for a real drink.  Totally waste of $$$$More,I'm going to put it quite simple: just for the fact ofdrinking alcohol inside a Disney park, in a Star Wars bar... I don't care paying +$20 for a poorly done cocktail. 
The DJ is a droid! What else you can ask for?,I came in with my young teenage sons. I asked our bartender Tre if they had any blue or green milk beverages, and he asked us with whether we wanted to be at the milk cart instead of the cantina. (There is a blue milk...beverage at the cantina which was in plain sight - but I guess he didnâ__t want to talk about it?) 

The host staff advised you that you have 45 minutes inside this location. (Itâ__s also almost only standing room - no bar stools at all and only 6 tables.) My sons were served almost immediately, and they were finished with their drinks before I received my order. These drinks are all poured from a spout and I saw my Yub Nub tap spray out air while he was trying to pour my drink. No explanation or apology, yet I waited another 15-20 minutes for my drink. I jokingly said, â__ I guess I ordered the wrong drink tonight,â__ and he said, â__Stuff happens.â__ I was beyond surprised. I said, â__I hope they wonâ__t be kicking me out in 20 minutes and again he had zero empathy. This is not what I expect when I go anywhere but definitely not from Disney. This was my first time feeling let down by Disney staff that did not seem to care.

It got worse. When I asked if there was a good way to transport the cup that you take home with the beverage (I was expecting maybe it would be rinsed out and packaged somehow?) he let me know that I should just wait and let him do his job. He brought me a brand new cup in a bag, which was awesome, but my jaw was on the floor with the way he spoke to me. Just wow.More,I would not bring young kids here.  Most tables have no seats. Drinks are pricey however, you are in Disney World. I really liked the cantina. We had a a great waiter named David Pham. He helped me decide on a wonderfully yummy drink. He...also kept us entertained while looking around at all the scenery. Try daily to get a reservation I randomly looked one evening and scored a table. Also, you have about 45 mins max inside.More,Must have a reservation, probably going to stand for your 45 minutes.  After 10-15 you're probably ready to leave.  Overpriced pre-prepared drinks.  Our server was very nice, though.  

But if you are really into Star Wars, it is probably worth seeing once, since the decor...is cool and the DJ is funny for a few minutes.More,We visited Ogas Cantina with a reservation for 12:35 and included in our reservation details that we had two children  aged 4 in our party. Evidently, no consideration is paid to the make-up of your party when doling out tables. We were finally let in...just before 1:00 (despite a supposed time limit parties are allowed to stay inside) and weâ__re escorted to a high top table with no chairs/bar stools. Our children were offered standard height high chairs which were way too short for the table (and at 4 they donâ__t typically sit in a high chair anyway so it was a struggle to get them to even climb in). Parents of toddlers will understand little ones wonâ__t tolerate being out of the action so their time seated there was short lived. Two booths opened up within 3 to 5 minutes of our arrival but we were told we couldnâ__t switch tables as they were reserved for parties of 7 ( we were a party of 6) - instead weâ__d have to wait outside for approximately 45 minutes if we wanted to put in a request for a booth. A party of 4 was seated not long after we asked to swap. The high top would have maybe been okay if the high chairs were taller (and our children were younger) but even then, itâ__s not a guaranteed respite from being on your feet in the Florida sun. We asked if we could pull up bar stools and were also told â__noâ__ even though there were no tables beyond us to which weâ__d be blocking the path. Ultimately, not worth a return trip for us, even if seated in a booth. The cookies served with the blue milk were hard as a rock and our two just ate the frosting off the top; I donâ__t blame them. Some seats donâ__t have a view of the DJ either, so even if youâ__re party is only adults, unless you luck out with your seating, it can be a letdown.More,A must do experience for star wars fans and theme park enthusiasts, Oga's Cantina is an innovative experience like no other. It is essential to have a reservation and expect a wait to get in. The experience itself lasts up to 40 minutes to see...all the little details happen and get the most of it. You will be told where to sit and that is where you must stay for the duration of the time, no wondering about as you want to. It is set up as though in the film and gives you the feeling almost of being an extra. The drinks are very good but expensive and there is a few things to eat but no meals. Overall we enjoyed the experience but would love to see a proper restaurant in Galaxy's Edge.More",None,
"I've hung out at Dubai Mall so often yet it's just this time that I ended up walking into this restaurant for lunch. Loved the decor and cherry blossom theme, the food was great too. The customer service though was just about transactional not very...friendly.More,Food was good. But staff very unfriendly and very disagreeable. They are just not interested to serve. This was our 3rd time here and we even made a complaint before but things have gotten even worse. One dish was served without the sauce which was...the main ingredient on the menu and when we asked they just said oh you want sauce? Cutlery was just thrown on the table and glasses not given for the water we ordered. We will not come back mainly because of the staff attitude. Maybe they are treated very badly by management and they take it out on the customers. Either way this is not acceptable especially when you pay more the USD 150/- for a simple meal. We saw many customers complaining as well. It's obvious the management has no interest in customer service. Very very surly attitude.More,Great Japanese restaurant. You can eat in overlooking the Dubai Mall in the comfort of air conditioning or indeed watching the chefs make the dishes in the kitchen or sit outside overlooking the dancing fountains. Good service. Great food. Great Mocktails, I enjoyed a litre...of Pear and ginger with my giant udon noodles.More,Worst Sushi ever. Our waiter was always late and had no clue what he was doing. The sushi was extremely poor. Had a customer in front of us who kept eating all the sushi so we couldn't get any for ourselves. Not only this but...when we ordered the food it took 2 hours. The music made my ears bleed. I do not recommend this place to anyone.More,The place is nice and cozy despite being in a mall. 
Thatâ__s why we walked in. 

Unfortunately after a good miso soup, the rest of the rolls were quite upsetting. Hard to get the difference one from the other. 

Service can definitely improve in speed...and attention but overall the waiters are nice.

I personally do not recommend.More,Horrible hospitality, subpar food and overall felt unwelcome. Went to complain to the restaurant manager but was given a feedback form.

If you're happy to pay premium for subpar food this is the place to go. Not recommended.,ð__¼ð___ð__¼ð___ð___ð___ð___ð__¼

Recently I was invited by @tanukidubai  located in Sharjah Zaiha!! 

A Japanese newbie in Sharjah city center zaiha!! 

Amazing new restaurant. Creative take on Japanese/Thai food. Square sushi and tanuki-yam soup (tom yum). Genuine and kind waiters/waitresses. The food was phenomenally fresh and tasty....Love this place.

#foodblogger #foodies #uaefood 
#foodimoms #uaeblooger #dubailife #dubaiblogger #bloggerMore,Hospitality below zero. Rude personal. Food is not good not badâ_¦ just regular rolls. Restaurant was pretty empty, but have to wait for an order for 50 minutes. (Rolls only) 
Disappointed. Not the way food could be in the center of Dubai.,Horrendous waiting time, terrible service, orders came piece by piece, very average quality, pricy.
Totally overrated in the reviews we have seen,We were excited to try out this place as we love sushi but were utterly disappointed by the quality and the way we were treated.Our waiters messed up the order and were rude while trying to correct there mistake.They banged the bottle of water on...the table.when we complained about the freshness of the dish our waiter was not apologetic neither was a manager seen.

What a complete mess and waste of time dining here! 

Would never recommend this place to anyoneMore,If you are a family with kids, and want your kids to have something to eat - then choose another restaurant. We ordered two kids menus and rolls etc for us, we got our food but our kids didnâ__t get anything - I asked for...the food 3 times, but nothing came. We left the restaurant, the staff and the manager are NOT educated to handle this kind of situations. I can also see on the reviews that the management  of TANUKI donâ__t reply on bad reviews -  that says it all of this place.More,We were 2. After 25min of our order, our table was empty, not even drinks. I asked them and they brought one cold main course, after 15min they brought the other main course and when we finished our food, they brought the starters. We never...saw our drinks, but they did not forgot to put them on the bill. The attitude of the staff is bad (except one filipino lady that was very nice) the rest was impolite and zero service manners. Food quality also disappoints.More,The staff does not reflect the essence of a good customer service. The menu was confusing 2 Arigato listed on their menu.

They does not reflect the real japanese character.,The Arigato, Mango Ebi Roll, Tempura Nori, Teriyaki Beef were all very good. Service was a bit slow but made up by the food. Priced at an average of 120 AED per person.,I Had the ramen good flavor average quality of Nuddles I will say I enjoyed ,the price is ok compared to other similar places Sushi was good.",The service now is basically non existent but replaced by remote controlled robots who bring the food to the table. The robots are dirty...and food spilled over not cleaned. It was interesting to see...an A.I. Robot waiter at work in this place.,
"Got showed in and ignored the whole time we were at the cafe. Ended up leaving without buying anything.,Overall, place was fine,.  Service was reasonable if not attentive. However for a gundam cafe, there really was not a lot to experience other than some videos playing and some sound effects in the WC.  Menu did not seem to have much to do with...gundam except for a few items and the place itself did not have a lot to see or experience.  Could have been a cafe anywhere that put up a toy robot or two.  So quite disappointed but coffee was ok.More,This cafe is much publicized but there is very little to justify it. The waitresses are bad mannered, rude and aggressive. We left before ordering and they physically tried to block our exit demanding money. 

Avoid at all costs.,The cafe have nice location close to the Akihabara Station and you can reached easily 
The only thing is so crowded and you need to wait at least 10-15 minutes outside till you find table
So if you are I a hurry choose another cafe,The theme is great. Fans will recognize stuff from the series. But the food and drinks are very average and overpriced.  Good to stop by for a cold drink during the summer.  Go elsewhere for lunch/dinner.,Super novelty, latte is on convenience store level was expecting crazy latte art but realised it's just a coco shaker to make the gundam animation lol kinda cool I guess but super whatever,This cafe has absolutely nothing.hyped up.the waitresses were rude,not at all with kind culture of Japanese people.they said the wifi was only for the owner.dont visit.,Donâ__t visit this place. Nothing Gundam themed about the food except the names. The food is absolutely disgusting and made me feel sick. The strawberry soda tasted 100% fake (A terrible, sweet, plastic taste) and the burger is worse than McDonalds. Service is okay, but...not great. The restaurant is shoddy and the toilets are filthy and have a broken soap dispenser.More,Went to the Gundam cafe as we were desperate for a good coffee and something sweet to eat. 

Don't do here for either.

The lattes are so week they just taste of milk.

The sweet items are a bit weird. My wife's ice-cream had crisps...in it along with corn flakes.

The cafe itself it quite nice with Gundam theme throughout and old episodes playing on a screen. Other than that, give it a miss unless you are a huge fan of Gundam.More,The service and food were very good. I enjoyed the theme and I'm not even a Gundam fan. The price seemed to be on par with everything else in Tokyo. To be honest for some reason I was expecting a lot but I still enjoyed...it.More,We visited on an unusually cold ( it was 4 degrees Celsius) rainy & windy day on 10 April afternoon . It was a much anticipated visit for my adult son who has grown up with Gundam robots & cartoons. This Cafe was on his...Wish List. I was cold & wet from the rainy walkabout in Akibara. The cafe was not full. Being matured, I stepped through the entrance to hide from the rain & wind. Despite my plea of â__ Iâ__m very coldâ__, the â__ captainâ__, a young lady in pink insisted on shooing me out of the door, back into the rain & wind, to stand behind the red line to wait , to be ushered. There was no heart in this customer service experience. Rules are rules. I would have left if not for the fact weâ__ve traveled thousands of miles into Tokyo and would not want to disappoint my adult sonâ__s wish to re-visit his childhood world of Gundam cartoons. Within 2 mins of standing behind the red line, another Server ushered us into a not full cafe. The food & drinks are overpriced, justified by the trade mark cartoon characters. A cup of hot coffee with your chosen characterâ__s face on the froth is ( alas) only half a cup full! Nothing special in the menu, save for the characters names, pictures as ornaments. Everyone around me was a tourist, in there for the world of Gundam cartoons. Perhaps the only thing noteworthy is the Washroom where you do get a surprise when you dare to hit the Emergency button. Iâ__ll say in conclusion as a personal opinion,  there are more worthwhile Theme Cafes in Tokyo to visit. You can skip this.More,The service here is terrible to the core. If there is 0 stars, I will definitely rate that. The queue have been waiting for 30mins, patrons have exited the place yet no one served us in. I entered the place and questioned why, and they...just requested me to wait outside in the cold. Both reserved and unreserved areas have empty seats. It wasn't this case back in 2015 when I visited. Time is 8p.m. JPT when this review is written. 

Photo per attached to show the cafe being half empty.

This is the worst and unexpected service from Japan I ever encountered.More,We visited here because my husband is a fan of Gunfam wing but even for a fan this place is underwhelming. Compared to all the other bonkers, over the top places in Tokyo it doesnâ__t really have that much Gundam stuff apart from showing it...on a tv and a few cardboard cut outs. The staff were incredibly rude (first time we had encountered this in Tokyo), shouted at us to get outside until there was a free table. Then when we had a table they seemed reluctant to serve us. We didnâ__t have high expectations for the food as itâ__s more of a novelty place but wasnâ__t even that much of a novelty!! Total waste of time and money, even for a fan.More,Me and a friend visited here after my friend being a huge Gundam fan, me not so much and this was one of the themed restaurants on his to do list whilst in Tokyo.  We felt that the service was quite slow and the food...was ok not great, the staff seemed friendly enough though.  I got a burger and my friend got a curry and my burger felt like it was almost on par with the rustler  burgers you can get here in the UK.More,Very small restaurant with limited menu. The food was good but it just seemed like a tourist trap to me. The service wasn't good compared to other places in Japan and the wait was too long. The Gundam OST's in the background started to get...annoying.More", Having wolfed down the first course we decided to try the chicken teryaki with egg rice which was served by the hilarious if slightly pointless robot as well as the waitress. A varied and interesting menu which was served by human and robot. I enjoyed bring served by a robot and the friendly staff too,
"Okay so I want to start by saying that the milkshakes are delicious there is no denying that. However, this place offers sit down savoury meals and they just donâ__t deliver what youâ__d expect. The food is average I believe what you get as â__quick...serviceâ__ in the parks is nicer, our food was cold too but weâ__d waited over 50 mins we couldnâ__t wait any longer. The place is too big and clearly overwhelmed, it was raining on the day we went and they said that the tables were running 15 mins behind because people werenâ__t leaving the restaurant - well, tell them you need the table? Also their text system doesnâ__t work, we got the text 15 mins into our meal so thatâ__s something to look out for if youâ__re thinking about going. Yes itâ__s a lovely theme, great shop (although over priced) but I donâ__t believe they should offer sit down savoury food, especially French fries they were disgusting. Oh and an umbrella in the shop was $14 and it was $11 in the comic store in IOA for the same umbrellaâ_¦More,Wonâ__t be returning! My family and I had dinner here last week while on holiday in Orlando. I had wanted to try it out as a few of my Facebook friends had posted from there and I wanted to find out what the fuss was...about. We hadnâ__t booked and when we tried to book around 2pm they werenâ__t taking any more bookings but said we could try later as they accepted some walk-ups. We went in around 6.30pm and waited 50 minutes for the table.  I was anxious to see inside and experience it but when we received our â__table readyâ__ text and went inside we were promptly taken outside to the outdoor seating area. This had a marquee type appearance with lots of empty tables which were cluttered with dirty dishes, no effort at decor to make it more appealing and our table cutlery consisted of 4 napkins and 4 dirty knives. There was zero atmosphere and we felt like second class citizens. We could have been anywhere! The server wasnâ__t particularly pleasant and service was very slow. I had the chicken Bourgignon which was tasty enough but cold.  We didnâ__t get to experience what the restaurant was like inside but I can live with that because I certainly wonâ__t be back there! Unfortunately it was the last night of our holiday when we went there and wish we had gone to Hard Rock Cafe instead as that was a totally different experience.More,Unlike all of our other dining experiences (researched and selected before arriving) in Orlando, this place was the only one that didnâ__t meet expectations and in fact fell well below.  Service is slow and food quality extremely mediocre.  Also, donâ__t bother arriving earlier for a...reservation hoping to get seated earlier, youâ__ll still get seated well after your reservation time anyways (something I wish they had told us upfront when we initially arrived an hour in advance.)  Try Mythos or Cowfish for your main meal instead.More,Stayed In universal resort for a week visited several restaurants on citywalk.

Nice menu with plenty of choice daughters shared a mint milkshake didnâ__t managed to finish.

Meals pretty good comparing although my teriyaki burger bun was rock hard so left and just ate burger...well cooked and good flavour. Daughter had chicken bercy I was jealous !! 

Kids pasta and flatbread. Highlight was may contain nuts dessert to share between four plenty left but delicious. 

Would recommend for experience and service  but better food elsewhereMore,Beautiful Building, Just have dessert. Food was nothing but Horrible. Not sure what type of Ingredients are used.  Chicken was processed, not fresh. Fries were cold and not cooked. Rissotto was not good. Service was ok. I wouldn't waste my time sitting down to eat.,The shakes are amazing and they will accommodate any dietary preferences.
The signature dishes added a wonderful twist on classic American fare, the 'coffee and chocolate stout chicken wings' were delicious. Great service, even better food.,Hey Harry,

Thank you so much for this wonderful 5 star review! I love that you had a fabulous time with us, and look forward to welcoming you back to the table again soon!

-Chrisy,Myself and my partner visited for dinner after a long day at Universal. We both had the chicken bourguignon and was absolutely delicious! Although they looked incredible, we didn't fancy a milkshake after eating dinner but we did have the triple chocolate bread pudding which...was very good. We had a great experience with amazing food, excellent service and a fun experience. Definitely worth a visit!More,Hey there,

Thank you so much for this amazing 5 star review! I love that you had a fantastic meal with us, and can't wait to welcome you back for the factory for another!

-Chrisy,This place has become a must on our list. The kids always enjoy the over the top milkshakes. The risotto and flourless chocolate cake are amazing.,Hello,
Thanks so much for your review! It's awesome to hear that you enjoyed so many of my favorite dishes; I definitely recommend checking out our Warm Chocolate Almond Bread next time! See you again soon!
-Meaghan,We came in around midday and only had to wait ten minutes to be seated which was a pleasant surprise. We had three of the large milkshakes and ordered sandwiches also. The food was delicious and Malcom (our server) was very kind and helpful with...my mothers gluten allergy giving her plenty of options and suggestions, thank you Malcom!More,Hi Hollie,

Thank you so much for this amazing 5 star review! I love that Malcom took wonderful care of your mother during your meal with us, and I'll be sure to send this #UOFistBump over to them. I can't wait until we can welcome...More,Booked months in advance, but in arrival, our booking was confirmed. We â__checked inâ__ and were told we would get a text when the table was ready. The lobby area and shop were absolutely chaotic! Like being in a rugby scrum. Some folk were trying...to argue they had bookings, but had no evidence of a bookingâ_¦.. so got a little heated before they left. Others in lobby were grumpy due to high number of folk either waiting to be seated or just hoping to get walk in tables.
We had out text about 10 minutes later and we were seated upstairs.
It was light outside, so the lighting didnâ__t seem too bad. We had some brief interaction with the 2x characters, but fortunately they left us alone after that (2 sons aged 14 and 16 not that impressed, they just wanted food).
We ordered starters. 1x specifically being the Pork Belly Sliders with Chocolate Bacon. Only really ordered because of the bacon.
Before starters arrived, it had started to go dark outside, so did the restaurant. By the time we came to eat, our table was in darkness. No lighting over us or pointing at us at all. We couldnâ__t see what we eating, so had to use the torches on 3 of our propped up phones in order to see what we were actually eating.
The pork belly came out and what a huge disappointment they were. The tiny thin slice of pork belly not only wasnâ__t as big as the slider, but it was also as thin as a piece of bacon. This isnâ__t what Iâ__d expect from a piece of pork belly. More disappointing was the main reason I ordered the pork belly, the chocolate covered bacon, wasnâ__t even with the dish. 
Fortunately, the waitress went to get some, but it took so long all the other starters were finished and the sliders were cold and half eaten too. (The bacon was nice though).
Mains were all ok.
Desserts were huge sundaes. Very nice and filling.

Have to say, our waitress (didnâ__t get her name, little red haired girl with glasses) was fantastic. Spent a lot of time apologising for a restaurant that makes a lot of mistakes, has poor lighting/table arrangement and was ultimately a big let down, after we had looked forward for so long to eating there.

Could be amazing. But it isnt. And thatâ__s a genuine shameâ_¦â_¦More,Hello Gavin,

I deeply apologize for the issues you encountered during your meal at The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium. While I am happy you entrees were enjoyable, I am truly sorry for the disappointment with your appetizers. This is absolutely not the experience we want our...More,First visit - reservation for evening meal. Server was polite and offered recommendations from menu, from that point was then seldom in attendance. Waited an hour for meals and standard was mediocre at best.
Second visit - purchased milkshakes to drink/eat after long day at...parks. Shakes were adequate but servers slapped reserved signs on all tables with no explanation and tried to hurry along customers that had already purchased goods and waited 20 minutes for shakes.

Overall, poor experience and in our view, very overrated, such a shame as all in the party were looking forward to visits.More,Hello Mark,

I am truly sorry to learn of your disappointment with both of your visits to The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium, and for the delays and interactions you had with our Team Members there. This is not at all the experience we want our Guests...More,Whilst the food was nice we only went in for lunch and ordered 2x chicken sandwiches, a steak sandwich and a portion of kettle chips. This took over an hour to arrive.

We then ordered dessert and waited a further 70 minutes. 

Iâ__d strongly recommend...only going here if you have an afternoon spare.More,Hello Chris,

I am truly sorry for the wait time you encountered to be seating with us, as well as for the delay you experience in your food arriving. While I am happy you enjoyed your food once it was brought out, I deeply regret...More,Not the experience I hoped it would be unfortunately. I thought the place would be more quirky than it was. The decor was all projections on screens round the room rather than actual machines. Lighting was dull, table wobbly (our server tried to fix it...but to no avail.) and the food was average. 
Our server Cris however was excellent - very polite and friendly, attentive and quick. 
When I booked the system asked if it was a special occasion so I added we would be celebrating my daughterâ__s 21 st birthday. In the additional comments section I asked whether or not they might be able to provide a cake for her. Not only did no-one get back to me about my request but no-one even mentioned her birthday when we checked in or whilst we were dining there which I found rather shocking. 
We will not be returning and would not recommend it as a place to eat either.More,Hello Katy,

I am truly sorry to learn of your disappointment with your visit to The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium. While I am happy Cris was a highlight during your meal, I regret this didn't continue through the rest of your experience. I'll be sure to...More,Made reservations months in advance. We arrived early and the waiting area was so packed that we felt uncomfortable, given we are still dealing with a pandemic. There is a shop to buy baked goods and macarons, etc. right where people wait for their tables....We watched a staff member taking her break right in the middle of all of those waiting. She was rubbing her nose and pretending to wear a mask. She had some unkind things to say about management and staffing. It turns out she was one of the hostesses. We asked that she not be the one to seat us. The restaurant is fairly dark and loud and crowded. We ordered sandwiches and they were nothing special.  We decided not to order dessert. It was just too noisy and chaotic in there. First underwhelming meal at CityWalk. Would not go againMore,Hello Sheryl,

I deeply apologize for the delay you encountered with your reservations, as well as for the behaviors displayed by our Team Member at The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium. We expect our Guests to be treated with kindness and respect, so it's concerning to learn...More,Having dined here in May and had  a bad experience with characters dressed as robot and English woman we should have stayed away . My husband wears hearing aids and they stood next to our table for 15 mins carrying on with other people  making...it impossible for us to have a conversation . Returned today and as we were seated they approached table . I gestured for them not to stop and the woman was really rude . She asked me why I was gesturing and  explained I didnâ__t want them to stop . She was then incredibly rude and walked away . She could have broken character there was no one around and I donâ__t think character is that rude Even my daughter was taken aback how rude she was . There should be a way to stop them bothering you when you donâ__t want them .  Eat here very time we are in Florida but think this will be our last .More,Hello Denise,

I deeply apologize for the behavior of our Team Members during your meal at The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium. We except our Guests to be treated with the utmost respect in all situations, so it's concerning to read about these interactions. I'll be sure...More",The best service is from Hoda and her robot assistant. One other annoying innovation is the little robot that brings the food out.,
"First, let me start with the Bloomin Onion- it seems to have gotten smaller but it never disappoints. It has to be one of our favorite entrees from any restaurant. Now for the steaks- I had the sirloin and it was a little tough. My...wife has the filet and it was very tender. I recommend paying more for the filet on any future visit. Service was very good.More,No one waited on us for at least 10. Then waitress for another area she said she would get tell waitress. We ordered the n waited for water. Asked if we wanted bread and then waited for it. Got my salad. Another server brought our...food. When we were almost she came asked if everything was ok. All in a hurry. No conversation just placed the bill on the table. Just plain rude.More,We appreciate you letting us know about your experience.  We take feedback very seriously and have shared this with the teams involved.

Thanks, mate!

Outback Steakhouse Guest Relations,Made reservations and the servers wearing masks, single time menus, ask for condiments. Menu not as large but a good variety. I had the chicken and grilled shrimp Alfredo. The chicken was so moist and flavorful. Really enjoyed. My husband chic tortilla soup, sirloin and...stuffed potato. There still is the wonderful warm bread. Server was attentive. Great food, safe environment and good service. Kudos for opening safe.More,Let me start by saying I eat steak very rarely but today the kids were jonesing & we ordered takeout. I got the bone in rib eye, ordered rare and it was cooked perfectly. Usually 9/10 chefs will not send out a rare steak &...most times I'm eating alone after the re-do. Again, it was perfect in temperature, presentation, & taste. The side caesar salad was satisfactory. It is pretty standard, nothing special. The baked potato was of good quality, perfect temperature & consistency with chives & sour cream on side. Finally, the carrot cake was a more than adequate serving and it was absolutely delicious, nuts & cream cheese frosting. All accompaniments were nicely packaged, no leaks of anything, temperatures maintained, and overall very nicely put together. It's not cheap but you get what you pay for. Nicely done.More,They do give the 10% discount but  you have to ask for it. Our waiter wasn't sure so had to go ask management. The draft beer equipment was down when we came in (fixed within half an hour) so I wasn't able to order the...beer that I wanted to try. I ordered the steak, lobster and shrimp special. Didn't know they had lobsters that small-think it was two bites. Shrimp was ok but pretty bland. The steak however was very well done. French Fries were disappointing. Not a lot of taste and not a decent sized fry.
Wife ordered the Steak/Lobster combination. She said her steak was also very good. Her lobster was a little larger than what I received.
We split a dessert-the brownie and ice cream-that was very good.
Service was excellent but think I'll just stick to ordering their steaks in the future.More,We have went back 3 times and they still could not cook a steak well done. The service was horrible, Could not cook a well done steak after coming back 3 times.,Service was good, the atmosphere was ok, a little noisy for me. My friend's steak was just fine, but when I got my salmon it looked like salmon but it was white, not pink as it should have been and it was tasteless.  The seasoning...on the surface was fine but the fish its self had no flavor.More,Hello Richard,

This is not the ideal quality we strive for.  Your feedback means a lot to us and will be taken into consideration for the future.

If youâ__d like to get in touch directly, please fill out our Contact Us form and we will...More,slow service , way to seasoned meats etc, small portions for what your charged ,not overly friendly ,but the blooming onion is good,We love the sirloin steak, salad and Mac and cheese. We always have great service here. July was no exception. We had a waitress in training and she did great! The drinks are reasonably priced as well. You must get the blooming onion or the...blooming onion petals (a smaller version). The blue cheese pecan chopped salad is a favorite of mine as well. Thanks for. Great atmosphere, with great food, amazing service and good prices.More,If youâ__ve been to an outback this one is not differentiated. Food is standard. Too spicy for my standards and not very fresh or well prepared. Service was average. Bathrooms were dirty.,stoped by for dinner on our way home.  we were please to get in with a short wait.  food was good and at a reasonable price.,Stopped here for Saturday lunch. There were only about 10 parties in the place. Waited 5 minutes after being seated to go to podium to ask if we had a server. She finally came around. It was almost 15 minutes before we had our waters...and she took our order. Our server today lacked motivation although she was friendly enough. Disappointed today based on other previous experiences at this restaurant. Will always be back though as we love their rewards program.More,My kids love this place. Itâ__s always loud and busy, so I never worry about them causing a disruption.
Pros: Burgers are excellent
2-for-1 drinks all the time
Good daily specials (especially their wing night)
Cons: service can be slow 
If you order bottled beer,...it is never very cold for some reasonMore,Back for our dine rewards 50% off dinner. The service this evening was not as good as previous visits. We were waited on by the bartender even though we were sitting in a booth in the bar area. The server didn't think he needed to...write down our orders and of course, it got screwed. The manager did come by to talk to us as we had a bonus card that wasn't working the visit before and she very kind and considerate.  The sirloin steak and pork porterhouse were very good as well. Next visit we are going to try the main dining area.More,Ordered their Outback burger. Asked for extreme light on seasoning. Choose NO cheese or bacon. NO mustard. My meal came 25 minutes later with cheese on & fries luke warm. Sent it back. New burger came extremely salted. This is my 2nd & final time...I will ever eat there. Way over priced for what they serve.More", We went to this restaurant after we saw the show at the robot restaurant - right across the road and unmissable really.,
"Having had to wait in the drive thru queue for over half an hour, once order placed we had to pull over in one of the bays as no food ready.
We noticed that every driver that past us had to pull over wherever they...could in order for staff to eventually come out and give customers their food.
If the drive thru and restaurant are so busy that they are unable to cope with the numerous orders then they should stop taking drive thru orders for a few minutes in order to catch up with demand.
Once we got home, the quarter pounder burger was thrown together, no matching size buns, tiniest piece of onion and no sauce.  Chips were undercooked and soggy and the coke was flat.  
This McDonald's never seems to either get orders right, you have to wait for food for a long time and the quality of food is terrible.More,Visited and the restaurant was chaoticâ_¦. Mess on most tables floor filthy and no sanitiser in dispenser . Wish Iâ__d used the drive thru which was not that busy. Was refused to pay by cash which is what I wanted to do so was forced...to use the self serve screen to order and pay. A cheeseburger and coffee took 17 minutes to arrive. Numerous just eat or similar delivery services were served ahead of people waiting which you can see in the display is the case.  Food and drink both tepid when I got into my car to eat .  McDonaldâ__s needs to decide if they are a delivery service for other companies or want to serve people who want to visit their restaurant.  The delivery side of their business definitely takes priority â_¦ you only have to watch the screens and see whose order comes out first.  Will not visit McDonaldâ__s again in the U.K.  Rubbish customer service and food barely edibleMore,Ordered 20 nuggets....got home to find only 12 in the box. Nearly half. Fuming. 
Not enough characters in this review so il also mention the 15 minute wait time for half the food I ordered ð___,Popped for lunch with family and was absolutely hell, no queuing system in operation people all over the place standing over tables as your trying to eat, delivery drivers constantly coming taking over half the restaurant, waiting ages for food, all they seem to care...about is serving uber and just eat drivers, not how McDonaldâ__s use to be, this use to be a nice calm one to visit with family but will not be returning to this hell holeMore,We, a bunch of mature people in our 50s and 60s, attempted to ask (nicely) if we could order some food from the hatch after we had visited a friends 60th birthday.

We didn't have a car, but were very hungry and just wanted some...food.  If one of the staff had said ""look, were sorry but we cant serve you via the drive in when your on foot - as its not company policy"" then we would have said fair enough.  But to ask and be told to F OFF - this let you down.

Terrible terrible behaviour by the staff that night.  Saturday 16th October around 2a.m.

i hope your parents are proud!More,Should have kept the place as drive-through only as they canâ__t cope. Waiting outside for ten minutes I heard the delivery drivers mention there had been lots of items missed that day. When I entered, a member of staff started to have a go at...me for walking in but soon piped-down when I told her her colleague had told me to enter.After ordering, I had over a twenty minute wait for nuggets and chips! Two people who had ordered after me got theirs before me. When I mentioned my wait, there was no apology: just â__Weâ__re busyâ__. Being busy for drive-through and deliveries should not be the the detriment of the in-house experience.More,I took my family out to McDonaldâ__s here and it was great. I went an hour before closing but it was worth it. A man named Matthew or Matt as he told me when I asked, was a great staff member. Helped out whenever needed...and was with great attitude. Very friendly and I think the world needs more people like him. Thanks Matt ð___More,I went here Monday lunchtime whilst my dog was in the nearby animal hospital. Even tho they have restricted menu and capacity due to Covid, everything was very well organised and a lovely ""older"" (sorry) lady showed me to my table, offered to help me...with the ordering screen, and checked back on me a couple of times. The food, once ordered arrived very fast, completely as ordered, and hot. Couldn't fault anything at all.More,Food is the same as any McDonaldâ__s, but the customer service is one of the best if not the best! There is one member of staff that stands out and greets every customer, helps everyone and has a very positive attitude,I was just buying a meal and a worker by the name of Lindsey was rude and aggressive never go there!,Called in to McDonald's after a heavy day of shopping. Staff were friendly and polite as always, food was cooked to my specifications - no salt on fries plain burger, it was busy but the tables and floor were constantly being cleared. Good atmosphere, would...go there again.More,useless place.dont trust therm with your food.there is a 30% chance u will get your whole order whether you go ninstore or order through uber.they are not even willing to deliver the missing items when u get it delivered.once i ordered a burger and got...a bun with sauce and pickle yet no burger.dont trust this store.also always dirty insideMore,All the food was warm to cold and the drinks were weak .....service was slow.....I have been living in Canada and the US for many years the Mac is SO much better than in the uk.....WHY......This is not the only Mac what has been bad.....,We visited the Mac Donaldâ__s in Southend on Sunday evening was so blown away with the service Shirley gave us she collected our food for us and was helping everyone I think it was the best service I have ever had 
Well done Shirley and...thank youMore,We often go to McDonalds at Rochford rd. Either for a meal or ice cream or coffee. Staff always helpful and courteous and its clean including toilets mostly. Today toilet roll had run out in one ladies and it smelt a little, but usually all...okay.
However Graham stood out and wandered round the shop checking everyone had what they needed and if not obtained it (like colouring crayons). He also wiped our table before we used it and cleaned and cleared other ones. No one could call him lazy!!! Poor man probably earns low wages too.
Our Granddaughter enjoyed using the computers too.
We were also offered Table service which I agreed happily too.More","Well, I guess robots cooked the food.",
"Staff do not listen ð___ they are too wrapped up in their own world  never ask if you want sugar and burgers look like they have been thrown together without a care ð___ .
If your on your way to work they have all day...when your in a rush thats why its called fast food duh!More", We booked dinner here as a package deal with our Robot Wars tickets.,
"Yellowtail on Tiny Town is the best restaurant in Clarksville! It's absolutely the best in menu selections, food quality, flavor, prices and atmosphere! It's always the most bubbly spot for friends, date nights, and any celebrations! I've been multiple times - every visit has been...a great experience!More,Rude Rude Rude Employee at reception.  We went there for lunch around 13:10 on 29 January.  As always it is busy and normal to wait a bit.  There was nobody at the bar so we asked if we could be seated there.  She rolled her...eyes and her whole body language just said +^^%##%* us.  We asked if there was a problem and she said we wanted to give the kitchen staff a break.  No issue for waiting 40 minutes as we were happy to sit at the bar and enjoy drinks.  I did not appreciate her nasty attitude and left.More,Just so you know they are charging an 18% surcharge on top of the cost of your food and tax. Not sure if they are employing their wait staff or not. Hoping they are since I paid it.,Due to our usual spot being closed, we thought we give this place a try. Big mistake!  Iâ__ve tried sushi all around the world, the quality at Yellowtail is worse than gas station sushi. If youâ__re in town go to Fujiyama for sushi, you will...thank me later.More,Atmosphere, Service, Food Quality all the best in Clarksville for authentic or American style Japanese food. Fresh Fish always a must for Sashimi and Yellowtail wonâ__t let you down.,Picked this place out of the blue. Had the Nigiri sushi which is my favorite albeit simple. I was impressed with the food quality. I wish the rice portion was slightly warm with each piece but not a deal breaker. Place was busy. Young ladies...working near the bar were chatter boxes with friends sitting at the bar. So if you want to avoid that get a table away from the bar. Just young people doing what they do! No harm. No foul. Will repeat. Good diet food BTW!More,My husband says their sushimi is the best he has ever had. We get it in every time we are in Clarksville. I love their fried rice.,We LOVE Yellowtailâ__s food. The sushi is always amazing, and itâ__s one of our favorite places to have a date night. However, tonight my husband and I went on a date, and had an extremely rude waiter. We ordered quite a bit of sushi, like...we do on all date nights because itâ__s a special occasion and our cheat meal. When we placed our order, our waiter commented on the sheer amount of food we ordered (which was no more than we get every time we come). Then, every time he came to our table, he commented on how much we had eaten. He tried to take our plates away twice while we still had food left and made comments when we stated we were still eating. Then, at the end of our meal, he said, â__I would ask if you want desert but with how much you ordered and ate, I assume you donâ__t want any.â__  The food was delicious as always, but the waiter made us feel embarrassed and self-conscious, not something weâ__re used to feeling when we go out to dinner for our date night.More,Best sushi in town, hands down. The fire ones especially! Not too expensive for a sushi. Always full so plan ahead.,Not child friendly.

Let me start out by saying this review is not about the  food but instead the way my children and I were treated. The food is fantastic, however if you have small children beware. I have a three-month-old and a two-month-old who...were not happy for a brief period whIle eating with my family. The manager glared at my children and I as I was trying to comfort them. I made and maintained eye contact with her each time she stared at us. She never smiled at us but looked completely aggravated. Moments later the girls settled down and we proceeded to eat our meal. Upon leaving the manager stood at the door as we walked past and did not make eye contact with us but made sure to say said goodbye and thank you to the other half of our party who had invited us out to the restaurant.

Once my children were secure in the car with the rest of my party. I went back inside to ask the manager if children were welcome in the establishment. Of course now she is all smiles and said yes they are and she was simply admiring my children... which was not the case. I did not catch her name but should I return I will be sure to include it in this review.More,Birthday celebration for my granddaughterâ__s birthday. She picked the place. We were greeted and seated very quickly. Our waitress Danica, was efficient and courteous. She made sure our selections were correct before taking them to the kitchen. We had a variety of sushi rolls and...shumi. I had the filet with vegetables. For appetizers we had calamari and robatayaki (meat cooked on a rock). VeeMore,We chose to order and share sushi and also a combination dinner from the hibachi grill. Everything was very enjoyable about our meal; the food, the quality, the presentation and the service.,Really enjoyed the food and service. Try the green tea, specialty japanese sourced. Also, they have yazoo yazoo hefeweizen in bottle which is great. Sashimi is always good.,My husband and I love going to Yellowtail. Great for lunch and dinner. All of their sushi rolls taste great and fresh. Presentation is always beautiful and the facility is clean. Definitely one of the best sushi places in Clarksville.,I had never eaten at Yellowtail before because I thought it was a sushi only restaurant But I met some friends there for a birthday party on Saturday.  I ordered the Hibachi Teriyaki Chicken and fried rice.  Oh my goodness it was delicious.  So much...so that I was back there this past Wednesday night to order the same thing to go.  Twice in one week!! My friends that had the sushi said it was delicious as well.  Give it a try.  Service was wonderful and food was delicious! What more can you ask for?More", The cat-faced robot waiter that delivers food to the tables is very cool too. The robot also was very fun.,
"Not the fastest service but certainly edible.  Seating is largely upstairs.  Self service machine was a little temperamental.,The concept of â__fast foodâ__ has definitely left this place! After waiting almost 20 minutes for my food I then had to fight my way past the crowd of delivery drivers waiting for their collections. And in that 20 minutes I only saw 2 other...people actually get their food even though countless bags were taped up for collection. Maybe if they focused a little more on the customers in the store then it wouldnâ__t be so bad!More,So I went into McDonald's this morning and ordered on the screen. Straight away there was a problem over the fact that my screen did not print my ticket. After 20 minutes of waiting for my food with only 5 people ahead of me I...was thankful. I got our the store ready to eat and instead of getting a double bacon and egg muffin extra bacon, I got a single bacon and egg muffin with 2x extra sausage. From someone who has worked gor the company previously... seriously it isn't hard to ready a screen.More,Myself and a fellow nurse went to McDonaldâ__s to get lunch for our team at the hospital. When we got there, they only had a limited menu. 3 things we asked for they did not have it. Meaning 3 members of staff didnâ__t get their...well deserved meal!More,Our granddaughter is addicted to this chain and so we had no alternative. She enjoyed it, we just had a few chips to keep her company. Service was fast and well organised.,Ordered dinner for the family and my daughters apple pie had what looked like a ginger beard hair on it ð_¤®ð_¤®,Working in the area at night, walked there, ordered chicken and a apple pie for myself , plus mcflurry and hamburger for my work mate. On arriving back to my work area (10 min walk) I found they had not only forgot the apple pie...but put no napkins in either.  
I did check the receipt and I had paid for it.
Maybe if the manager wasn't so interested in talking to his staff....More,Iâ__ve ordered twice this week as itâ__s easy to get for lunch when Iâ__m working. Again they forget the dips including the ones I pay for. I usually let it slide as the dips are free or only 20p but I order here quite often...and the money wasted on buying dips is ridiculous! I only buy them in hopes they actually read the receipt and put all of them in! Iâ__ve rung a few times to complain but it does nothing and Iâ__m really annoyed now. You canâ__t just forget to put things in my order if Iâ__ve paid for them no matter how cheap they are! If you donâ__t sort out your service I wonâ__t be eating here anymore, Iâ__ll be forced to make a formal complaint to the Winchester manager. considering posting on Winchester rants aswel to worn others that my money is being taken every time I order. Itâ__s pennies but they add up and it ruins my meal. Please sort this out now.More,Very disappointed to have to ask ""floor manager"" Michael to wash his hands after I watched him wipe his hand on his trousers at least 6 times whilst waiting for my food. He then touched the hash browns to see if they were still warm....Oh also the guy in back making sandwiches vigorously scratched his arm and did not wash or sanitise his hands afterwards.

I would expect better under normal circumstances and under covid-19 restrictions hygiene should be top priority. Unfortunately, it's not at this restaurant.More,A fantastic luncheon in sophisticated surroundings for an absolute bargain price. Cannot recommend highly  enough.,That lady by the phone is rude . She needs more training on dealing with customers.. this mcdonald at Winchester,I wanted a caramel ice frappe but they only had ice latte and I thought I'll give it a try. I couldn't finish it! Weird mix of coffee and frappe, too watery! Don't order!,Iâ__ve Been to this McDonaldâ__s 5 times now; every time Iâ__ve received small portions - wether thatâ__s barely any fries or half a McFlurry. Itâ__s pathetic; as a previous McDonaldâ__s employee Iâ__m disgraced that they would serve such small portions!,This must be one of the worse McDonaldâ__s I have ever been to had to wait for 20 minutes for a seat.its was packed for of teenagers that were very allowed.i would never go back here again even the staff are rude.,Good for a quick snack off the High Street, it is not the cleanest establishment and this frequently spills  onto the street making it look less approachable."," Not sure what the Robots do, but certainly recommend a visit...if you like dumplings.",
"The food here is always amazing, the place is for sale and hope the new owners drop the prices, a pop and sandwich is over 20$,Excellent friendly service a great food at a reasonable price.  Have been many times and everything is consistent visit yo visit,Nothing impressive.  Firstly no gluten-free options that my friend could eat.   Staff lacked knowledge on whether the food was gluten free.  Staff also informed us that the turkey in club was real turkey (it was regular deli turkey) .  Fries were just ordinary frozen fries....I give this place 3 stars because plenty of options and food was at least hot and fresh.More,My family and I are visiting from Louisiana and stopped in here for lunch. The first thing we saw was a sign next to the menu that read ""Thanks to government handouts, nobody wants to work anymore so we're short-staffed"". 

We prefer a world where...people get help during hard economic times and don't blame others for their problems, so we'll spend our money elsewhere. 

Our home state was recently devastated by a hurricane and we're glad that the government is helping people. You lost a few customers today.More,I arrived at Trails End with a friend 2 weeks ago, July 23, 2021.  We got there about 20 minutes before closing, but we didn't know it was close to closing and they never told us when we notified the staff we planned to eat...in.  That gave us 20 minutes to order our food, wait for it and eat.  My friend ordered a small personal pizza with cheese and a couple of vegetables that cost $19 + tax.  I ordered a steak sandwich, it was so tough I couldn't cut it, my first experience with not being able to cut the bread of a steak sandwich.  I finally gave up and tried to pick it up and eat it.  I was about 1/2 way through my meal when a rude, I guess manager, threw a carry out box on our table and said ""You have to leave.  I'm letting my staff go because we're closed.  You can eat outside.""  Nice of her to let us eat outside in the rain. The young girl who originally served us was nice but the 2 larger women, I guess the manager and another staff member were very rude.  The food was overpriced and barely fit to eat.  I will never go to this restaurant again.  Probably my worst experience.  Too bad I had to pay in advance because they didn't deserve the tip I gave them.  They deserved nothing.More,We've had lots of pizzas here but today was a terrible pizza. It was burnt and over cooked. Hopefully we can try again.,Misery all around... food is great and pricey 
Staff all have these pouts on their face ... live in the town and wish to god someone would buy these guys out ... great location, great food.... but come on put a little smile or life...into yourself..
Go to cristellos next door and get the lady to make you a sandwich...5.99 huge and happy to serve youMore,It's a good local spot to visit if you are going to the hilton falls.they area bit pricy but they are local so excpect that.,Very disappointed in the order of fish and chips, mediocre portion not enough of a meal to feed a toddler.,Stopped for a coffee, friends added pie. Nice selection of homemade pies.coffee was okay, not great. They have $5  dinners. You can't beat that. Small place and busy
Parking outside had a couple Flo EV chargers,Nice little place off the beaten track.  Good Food, Good Pricing, Great staff. Lots of homemade food on their menu to choose from.  My only comment is that back and front of the house need to smile more :)  You're in the hospitality business! A...smile goes a lonnnnnnnng way. :)More,The restaurant was easy to get too as we wanted a place to stop for breakfast off the 401. The breakfast was satisfactory but nothing beyond expectations.,This place seems to be busy all the time but, the food is mediocre foe the price!  To me, it felt like a School cafeteria stye, you line up order your food and then wait.  Portions are small too.,Food is always amazing
Fries are real front ladies are always pleasant.... been eating here for 12 years.... never a bad meal.... but the owner and his wife, I think, are always miserable .... why????,Some places try to create an air of tradition by using words like ""Olde"" or ""Ye"" in their name, or hanging fake pioneer carriage wheels on the walls. The Trail Eatery doesn't need to do any of that. Originally called The Bruce Trail Eatery, this...staple of Campbellville has been serving hikers and locals for decades, without losing its unpretentious, down-to-earth origins.

The place is furnished with solid wood tables, and has one long bench to accommodate a group of twelve. Large windows on two sides provide plenty of natural light, and noise level is reasonable at 63dB(A). The counter-order, table-serve system works well, and tables have ample elbow room between them.

The atmosphere is relaxed and convivial, with the friendly staff quick and efficient without creating a sense of hurriedness. The menu goes well beyond conventional roadside diner fare, covering a wide range of pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, fish and chicken dishes, and an ever changing selection of freshly baked pies and pastries, as well as an in-house ice-cream stand.

Everything we tried was excellent. The chicken parmesan sandwich was succulent, the generous portion of fish was fresh, and the quesadilla as good as you'd find in any Tex-Mex place. The desserts aren't an afterthought like at many places. This place would thrive even if it only sold its pies, ice cream, and amazing brownies.

Prices are very reasonable, with breakfasts between $7 and $11, sandwiches and wraps $7-$12, mains $10-$14, and kids' meals $6.50. They offer a dozen different domestic beers in bottles ($5), as well as a couple of house red and white wines by the glass.

There's plenty of parking, easy wheelchair access and seating, but the washrooms are not wheelchair-accessible. Credit and debit accepted.More"," helpful, friendly staff (including the robot cat!), good range of drinks and great variety on the menu. The service was amazing as well, especially from their robot server, Bella.",
"Busy Mc Donalds. Could do with a little TLC in the form of maintenance. No working elevator to to bathroom which was a challenge to me as a disabled person. Food was served during the busy lunch time. Table service was not available for some...reason at the electronic order kiosk. The bathrooms smelt like they needed a good cleaning and one of the basins was not working.More,Usually a queue for the drive thru but ordering on the App makes it easy. Food is normally piping hot and orders are accurate. Just occasionally has it not been too hot or not right. Totally recommend this McDonalds. It is our 'local' and we...always buy from here.More,Absolutely disgusting service. Parked up & went in to order my food, ordered two breakfasts at 8:04 am no other customers waiting to be served, order took over 20 mins. Staff seemed more interested in having a chat amongst themselves.,Having a double cheese burger then in my mouth I felt hair then I spat it out and had a look and there was a big chunk of brown hair then frew up everywhere and chips were soggy to.,We live just round corner from here so got a take away. The grand big Mac was cold but the chips and selects were hot.,Back of house manager, was the most rude of all.
My daughter was extremely anxious I have video recording in my car of the back off house management. She was hanging out of the window telling me my accent was not clear. I had to...drive all the way home to report the back of house management.More,We visited recentlt for a quick eat in lunch, service was very good, they brought our meal to the table in a short time, staff were cleaning all the time which is why the place is spotless, we enjoyed our meal.,We don't really do McDonald's unless we get bribed by the grandchildren . Mainly because we are vegetarian and don't like fast food and rarely eat bread . We did try the one at the next exit of the A12 towards Ipswich a year or...so ago and it was awful . One mouthful and binned ! 
Yesterday we had to collect something from a shop on this retail park and were desperate for a coffee so called in . The young lady who served us was so helpful and friendly so we decided to try the veggie wrap . It was quite nice and the fries were actually hot and not like cardboard . The coffee was excellent . When the staff are so happy and the premises so clean it makes a huge difference to the whole experience . Well done .More,Never had any problems here. Quick service, restaurant tidy and the food is what you would expect to get at Mcdonalds.,she was a c *nt and ruined my holiday , I need air , please please please give me a refund please and thank you,As always food great and excellent service.   Restaurant is always spotlessly clean with staff constantly sweeping the floors.,We called in for a snack breakfast, what a mistake. We had to queue to order on screen, then a 10 minute wait for the completed order. I ordered a cheese/bacon wrap but without the cheese I have thrown better food away.  The wrap was...solid and when I opened it there were 2 TINY rashers of bacon most of the wrap was empty.  I was going to go to the counter to complain, but the queue was so long I gave up.   Never again.More,McDonalds is not known for its haute cuisine but even they should be able to get an order correct. You would think that a bacon McMuffin should contain bacon but it must have escaped the staff that this was a key item. Mine arrived sans...bacon. To be fair it was changed without fuss but so it should be. Also never have the latte. Although tastes nice itâ__s lukewarm/cold.More,Where do I start with Jaw dropping shocking experience. I know itâ__s a McDonaldâ__s so donâ__t expect the world but this is appalling.
I ordered food for through the drive way for my wife and son who were in Colchester hospital after an operation my...son had. I ordered I meal for my wife and meal which included 20 chicken nuggets to share for my son. When I got to the first window to pay young girl with glasses did not say hello or welcome or the repeat order just mumbled payment and offered me a card payment unit. Then no thank not a word so I waited for a receipt and waited, I then asked for the receipt and she said itâ__s at the 2nd window. 
I drove to 2nd window and collected the food and left. Once got to the hospital I realized the order was wrong. Charged me incorrectly. Drove back the 5 miles to bring the incorrect order back.
Manager comes to the counter what wrong? I explain. No apologies for the mistake no sorry how far have you had to come back. No my fault as I did not order the dips for the chicken nuggets. Not the staffs fault for not asking if I wanted dips. Unbelievable!!! Then a refund of _£4. Would not even cover the petrol. I was so outraged I said it is appalling service the manger still did not apologize!!! Just said I canâ__t refund your meal. I left in disbelief. McDonaldâ__s sort out your staff training it shocking from point of order to dealing with a customer complaint. By the way the large chips was also half filled up. The manager said I was on fries tonight and they wouldnâ__t be like that!!! I am a liar to. You just could not make it up. ShamefulMore,Quick service, staff polite and fairly clean. Plenty of parking. Food ok. Not much else you can say about it,it's the same as most mcdonalds. It does the job when your in need of something to eat quickly.","Pity the robot was at a standstill, so my grand nieces were not entertained by it. The century egg Chawanmushi was great and served by the robot too! They have a robot server which kept some young kids entertained.Interestingly they have a robot waiter to",
"Been here more than once and yet every time I hope the staff might be more polite they are not. They are rude. They are impatient. They make the customer feel like a nuisance.,I have seen some recent reviews re rude staff. Today they were not rude, just poor and inefficient at their jobs and lacking in customer service. Firstly they made a coffee for a customer that was wrong (not decaf). They put this to the side...and when I placed my order I heard the person serving me go over and say to the barista, 2 americanos so use that as one, indicating to the already poured coffee.
I ordered 2 smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels that were brought to our table outside still wrapped in cling film on plates with no accompaniment such as a few crisps or small side salad.  The bagel was small and over priced, again compared to others nearby. I wont be going back there and would recommend Delicacy near Grange Hill stn where the food is lovely and the staff great, especially the girl I believe called Chloe.More,Obviously a very special training in how to be rude and surly to your customers is a must to work in this deli. Its almost laughable how rude the staff are!!! Food is actually nice, but that is as far as it goes. Service is...beyond diabolical.More,Most the staff are so rude as if they donâ__t like having customers.
The owner is clearly not interested in getting decent staff, shame as the food isnâ__t bad but wonâ__t be going there again to be treated so badly.,Dismal staff. More interested in looking at their phones than serving customers.

Food looked ok, but walked out after after the 3 staff went on their phones simultaneously, instead of serving me. Piled up plates / cups on numerous tables.

How is this place still...in business?More,Hilariously rude disinterested staff who often get your order wrong and then somehow insinuate your to blame you. The blonde server with the glasses seems to be at war with herself and others. Shame the food is decent but there needs to be a drastic...root and branch shift in culture.More,As a small business owner, we thought that instead of going online to pay the big companies we would pay it forward and support our local small companies!  we wont be doing that again.  We call up at 12.45pm to place an order for 6...bagels as we didn't want to hold up the shop on a lunchtime.  Lady who took the caller was not very helpful, said we are ordering too much (6 Bagels) and that we need to pay deposit as she couldn't guarantee that we would collect.  i assured her we would but was more than happy to pay!  When my colleague got there to collect order, ladies behind they counter were very rude to her and said that we wasn't to place a order like that again as they wouldn't do it! we tried to explain that we thought it would help them but they were very dismissive!  We spent over _£37.00 there for lunch but unfortunately won't be taking our business there again.  We will find another small business who will appreciate our custom and our money.More,Bad food, bad staff and bad coffee.

1. Very bad experience with food there. Ended up spending the rest of the day in the bathroom.

2. Staff communication is not great, feel so sorry for the waitress working there today when the cashier just a...team player.

3. The coffee was burnt. (Extremelyâ_¦..)More,As a regular, I find the food to be very good and tasty. Everything, especially the bagels have been good and fresh but the two ladies there don't ever smile and act as if they don't want to be there. No passion in their work...and the prices are high which is fine as quality is good but service should also match but definitely does not. Change the staff and this place will be a lot better!More,I was treated badly by 2 rude female staff last November at this Deli. I was overcharged and got a refund when I complained. I have just visited again after one year and was treated in the same manner by the same staff. There was...also a problem with the bill again. I was treated like I had done something wrong and they both stood there glaring at me. I wonder if the manager looks at these reviews. I would not have them working for me! The deli is nice, but I don't want to visit again.More,Staff (probably Eastern European) at pains to tell us they were closing in half an hour. However they then 'got on with it' once all 5 of us started spending money!! My cheesecake and coffee were excellent. Other delicious-looking food also available and 2 of...us bought savouries too.  Could have been more welcoming, borne out by some of your other reviews. Handy for the tube though.More,Terrible staff wery rude they don't know about prices everyday different charges never again ð___ unfortunately this place not for chigwel they dont know how to say well-come goodbye thank you...terrible,Donâ__t go in! They donâ__t want you there.... 
You are disturbing their day by asking for ANYTHING
You are disturbing their day by merely existing inside their so called deli 

Ps I would have given 0 out of 5 but apparently Iâ__m not allowed...,Average in terms of food quality but staff have an attitude problem. Nothing special but worth dropping by if you need a sandwich for lunch.,Ended up here after our usual breakfast venue  was closed. What can I say ,dirty tables , rude unfriendly staff - she had a bad nights sleep apparently, cardboard panini, they forgot our tea overall the worst breakfast experience I have had in a long...time,how they remain in business I do not know AVOIDMore", When we made our order we requested the robot deliver our food.,
"Good environment with a good affordable menu to choose from. Roti bakar is the cafes specialty menu. I would say the quality of food above average at best. It is a good place to chit chat and meet up with friends. Inside the cafe its...air conditioned if you prefer to sit outside then it will be fans.More,Its slow in service, do not clean the tables, make us clean ourselves, make us take food bu ourselves, terrible,Various food from the menu and taste is good too. Excellent service by the staff. Free wifi and  is a close door with aircond. They have Breakfast/Teabreak/Supper menu with affordable price. Allow to use debit or credit card to pay the bills.,I am a regular costumer in Old Town at Aeon Big Ss16 Subang Jaya , lately their service became so bad , as it is not my first time getting discussed and frustrated from the kitchen and service , first time I got black hair...in Pan Mee Soup then I got a piece of egg shell , and today I got the same thing but bigger egg shell in my nasi lemak. Really disappointed ...More,A nice place to hangout with friends for breakfast or brunch. Please ensure you have made the reservation earlier, otherwise you will need to wait for your table. Nice food, big portion and a bid pricy compared to other places.,The Hazelnut Coffee is great. The bread is normal with kaya and butter. Price wise a bit higher if compare to normal shop. Good environment.,Literally tried everything on their menu last time and hereâ__s the summary 
Ipoh horfun is something I will order if I go old town 
Their nasi lemak is okay but just a bit too oily 
Hokkien mee or prawn mee is not too bad but...just way too salty 
Rice is like super mehhhhhMore,At RM5.90, one canâ__t go wrong with nasi Lemak or fried Mee Hoon which comes with a drink. Such an affordable combination in air-conditioned comfort is definitely a boon for anyone.

Other menu items costs a little bit more but offer the variety to the...discerning palette.More,Went there for supper. We ordered 3 sets but only 2 came. Waited for more than half an hour. Finally came n they waived off this 3rd set.,Breakfast with my aunties, my cousin and her husband after General Election results night. Restaurant is air-conditioned which was a big plus for me. Seating stools werenâ__t comfortable but served their purpose. In addition, it is a case of finding a free table (as is...the case in many a place in Kuala Lumpur). Ordering is via a chit sheet which can lead to incorrect codes being entered.
I opted for the Kaya Toast with an iced Milo drink. My drink came out very soon after our order was collected, and the wait for the toast was only around 5 minutes. I found both the Kaya Toast and the iced Milo drink excellent. I didnâ__t pay, but the meal was under 10RM (so under _£2) representing excellent value for money - in addition there is no expectation of a gratuity being a fast food outlet. Paying for the meal requires you to ring a bell at the checkout to gain the attention of a member of staff.
The place is highly recommended, and represents excellent value for money. Taking one star off for the confusion caused by the menu.More,Old town White Coffee is a famous chain coffee store within Msia. 

Must try drink will surely be the White Coffee and also the Nanyang Coffee. 

Not forgetting to mention the signature toast bread, garlic bread, sugar bread and the yummy Curry Puff.,I prefer the coffee over the food, Kopi Gao, strong milk coffee. Foodwise the usual pricier than coffee shop nasi lemak and curry mee. The toast and poach eggs are better.,For a quick bite and value for money Old Town is the place to go.
Setback for this outlet is parking lots are scarce and always full.,This Old Town White Coffee one of The oldest brand for Tea & Coffees. They have some Uniqueness & Services Remarkable.,After my Friend and I read through the menu and was ready to order I pressed the bell for service a couple times, no one came. We have to stop the waiter to pass our order.

When we ordered Nasi Lemak, to my surprise we...we told that the sambal chilli is not available therefore need to order something else. Food was alright however the service is horrible.More"," It has great service, referencing both the very helpful human staff who will help understand the system, as well as the more robotic staff, who will slide on by with an assortment of dishes ready for delivery with a smile on their faces.",
"Came across accidentally so was a very good surprise. Good variety of dishes with the right taste and well spiced. A nice Mediterranean atmosphere. 
Service was polite and efficient. A high standard of cleanliness.,During a recent European trip we had the delight to have a meal at this restaurant. I almost hate to leave a review because it is so good. During our 3 week trip this was one of two of the best meals we had. Excellent...staff, food and service.  We had the sea bass and it was delicious. They also have an excellent wine list.  Great atmospher with both indoor and outdoor seating on the banks of the Danube.  Doesn't get any better.  Highly recommended.More,Tonight we went there to have dinner for two people. Unfortunately we had a terrible experience due to poor service.

 We had to wait over 25 minutes for someone to take our orders and another 30 to receive the one meal we ordered the whole...night. When we asked for recommendations, we were basically slapped with the menu, due to the waiter being stressed/overworked. 

We have noticed that the staff had clear tension between each other, which has also resulted in cursing. One of our meal had zero taste, even after trying to season it with what we had at the table, which was such a disappointment given the hype and price point of this place. 

To crown our dinner, we had to ask for the bill 3 times and wait 20 minutes before being able to pay. All in all, we were hoping for a much better experience, as we have heard good reviews of the place, but we were left really unimpressed, most likely not returning again.

We hope the restaurant will sort out its staff, as they seemed pretty overwhelmed by the traffic they had to cover.More,The place looks even better than greek restaurants. Amazing place with very good food, lovely and friendly saff.,The food was delicious and the service was very welcoming and helpful! Excellent choice for a hot, summer day - must visit! â__ï¸_,Situated on the road next to the Danube, this authentic Greek Restaurant has an outside terrace and is really big inside. It has been fitted out really well and gives it a great atmoshere. All the food was super tasty and we had a great...meal, highly recommend.More,We had a main meal that was absolutely delicious, nice drinks, top service, with a small starter. a couple of slices of watermelon and a rose stem for my wife. We were very impressed. Also the decor inside  is lovely.,Located just next to the Danube river bank, this restaurant offers Greek food with a great friendly atmosphere. We had a very nice dinner here.,I just had the worst experience ever as a tourist. I had to pay a bill of around 14800 HUF and I wanted to pay in â_¬. The waiter told me I have to pay 52 â_¬. Right now the exchange rate is at around...0.0025 â_¬ per 1 HUF, so the total amount was of 37 â_¬. Basically the rest of 15 â_¬ were just a SCAM!More,Amazing restaurant,excelent food! Loved the greek salad!!â_¤ï¸_â_¤ï¸_ I would totally recommend it!!! 
P:S add photos in the menuð___,If you want to experience a meal that you will remember, this is the place to go! Not only is the food amazing, but the service and kindness from the hosts really puts the cherry on top. If you are lucky youâ__ll even get to...see a traditional Menetes home, and that is something you should!
Thank you so much we will come again next year!
Our baby also loved the food:)
PS: Order the stefadoð___More,Great greek restorant with big portion of food. Simply but great flavours. Kind and lovely staff. For every recomendation.,Favorite restaurant in Budapest. Nice location overlooking the river to Gellert Hill. Great menu with many selections. Service is excellent. I liked the salmon filet with the steamed vegetables. Had a salad as well, but was so much food, had to take portion with me....Made for two meals.  Went back another day and had some tszatski which was very refreshing in the hot weather. Had a garbides dish as well with three nice grilled shrimp. Very tasty.  The ladies get a nice rose after dinner as souvenir. Nice gesture.  Watch out for the robot waiter also.More,Went here in April on our last day the food was unreal got one of the platters, costs more than most meals in Budapest but itâ__s 100% worth it the service was unreal and was a good end to a trip,Fabulous. Very extensive menu. Lovely staff. Food fantastic. Would have loved an outdoor spot but we hadnâ__t booked so lucky to get a table at all.", A robot coming around to take your used plates; way cool! And their robot waiter also quite efficient. Additional perks is probably the robot dish collector that came out after the captain announce that they are closing the restaurant for the next batch of customer where the kids went gaga about it and start volunteering to,
"McDonalds Forbury Park is by far the best McDonaldâ__s on the planet.  This is my third occasion writing about them and they just get better and better. Love the selection of food on offer which is cooked to perfection.  Particular favourites are the porridge and...grilled chicken salad.  The buzz in here is also great.  Full of lovely people from all over Reading.  Everybody comes here and itâ__s just one of those must visit places in the lovely town. Always clean.  Good parking.  Excellent drive through which supported the community through the lock down.  Most of note is the exceptional staff.  They are truly are outstanding to a person.  Each of them is special and goes out of their way to make your day.  Thank you McDonaldâ__s Forbury Park for making people so happy.More,Thank you McDonalds for brilliant service and being so nice. The ice cream with raspberry sauce was the best ð_¥°,Useless, long waits and still canâ__t get the order correct (missing items & underfilled drinks) wonâ__t use again,McDonalds is the same world over. The actual food never looks like the promotional shots but you always know what you are going to get so it's really just comfort food. After two and a half years of on and off COVID 19 pandemic lockdowns,...my husband has really missed going to McDonalds and so I decided to take him to our local restaurant for our 32nd wedding anniversary dinner. After working out how to order through the touch screen thingy - there is no longer a counter at which to queue and place your order - we chose the ""table service"" option, placed our order and chose our seating. I had come prepared with paper plates, an electric tea light and even a rose in a vase to make the meal extra special. Our waitress was a little surprised but was very charming when we explained it was our anniversary dinner. Five minutes later the restaurant manager appeared at our table and asked us if everything was ok and even offered to warm up our fries. He then asked to take our photo and wished us a very happy anniversary. Ten minutes later the manager returned and gave us a free chocolate brownie. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal especially as it only cost us _£15 which is less then we would have spent on a bottle of wine if we had gone to a ""proper"" restaurant and may well come back for our 33rd wedding anniversary dinner.More,A double quarter pounder has two burgers in it not one. Clearly this was beyond the counting ability and comprehension of the staff here today! Sadly only found this when got home and too late/cold to walk back round! 

You guys really need to work...on your quality control!More,While I was waiting for my order it was a joke in so many ways. They had mixed two orders by giving half of one and then the other was someone elseâ__s and I had to check the order. The latte I ordered was disgusting.... Expect the worse anything you can eat and drink without throwing up is a bonus.More,I was left extremely disappointed when I went to get my breakfast this morning. Asked for my meal and the lady said "" we don't have hash browns do you want chips"" im sorry what?? the whole point of a bloody mcdonalds breakfast is for...the hash browns !! Why on earth would i want soggy chips with my breakfast.ð_¤®ð_¤®
This store is always running out of stock, the foods not that great and the service is slow. 
I wish I had driven a little further and stuck with my usual store as they are much better, they are quick,  the food is hot,it tastes so much better and they always have full stock.More,my daughters 14th birthday,went to the drive-thru and was told no cheeseburgers/no big tasties,so had to go some where else,try explaining that to a 14yr old,,3 times on the trot now theres been stuff missing in the bag , wonâ__t be going there again, will make the trip to Oxford road,terrible cold burgers, 3x and the couldnt get it right manager was useless, and not professional.
crap franchise,Here i am sat in my lonely bedroom, longing for the taste of a crunchy chicken wrap. Oh how i wish i could go back to the days when mcdonalds was more than a home it was THE home. Quarentine has ripped that away from...me at least it  has also ripped the 15 pounds i would have gained if i could still go. But thats besides the point because it was my life... my soul... my home. And i will tell you one thing. When this finishes you know where to find me. Without a doubt i will be home.More,Iâ__ve written previously about this McDonaldâ__s but it is truly excellent and worthy of another write up.  Staff are incredible and it is always clean.  You can sit here and chill or doing anything you need.  The manager is exceptional.  Thank you to the whole...team.More,Service was good and prompt. Location is a bit dated unlike more modern ones in Woburn and Burlington. Needs an update.,No ice creams or milkshakes again. They were pretty rude about it too. Kids were really annoyed. Had to drive across town,This is the McDonaldâ__s to come to.  They serve your food and they totally look after you.  You can work here, chill here and just watch the world go by.  All the staff are excellent and led by a superb manager.  The menu is varied...and in particular the ice cream is good. Highly recommend.More", I think I was dealing with a robot than a real person because a real person would have told me at first that the $20 fill up bucket priced had changed and the meal comes with coleslaw. Robots work this way for them.,
"Always a great experience. The arcades are great and a lot of fun. The kids have a great time also thr adults. The food is great and I haven't had any foul with the food. Highly recommended !,Went out for a post birthday dessert. What used to be the brownie tower is now the brookie sundae. Delicious blend of brownie and chocolate chip cookie and ice cream. New format is better designed for sharing as the tower could get real messy. If...you are wary of calories, stay away. If calories are not a concern, dive in.More,We out with the family  to celebrate kids Birthday. Kids had fun playing games although  the game card credits go fast. They were able to get some prizes with game play.  We went on a Thursday  around 5:00pm so it wasn't  too crowded
Weekends are...usually to busy to keep an eye on the kids.More,Used the groupon for 2 unlimited video game play cards. The groupon deal only allows you to play the video games with the ""blue"" card scanner. This includes almost all of the shooting and driving/flying games. It does NOT include any game where you can...win tickets (green card scanner) and does not include the new Jurassic World virtual reality ride (extra $5 per person). The groupon deal did include about 42 ""bonus chips"" that could be used on just about anything - my son used them all for a HALO multi-player video game. 
Still, on a rainy Election Day, we were able to get our money's worth by playing video games for 4 hours. Not crowded at all and we enjoyed lots of ""blue scanner"" games - Jurassic Park, Pirates, Transformers, Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Rambo, Galaga, Pac Man, Walking Dead, Aliens, Batman, etc. If you are going there with an older kid who enjoys shooting and driving/flying games - then I would recommend it. 
If you are going with smaller children who want to play ""fun"" games for tickets - I would avoid the groupon deal altogether. 
I will say that all of the staff that we dealt with were very polite, friendly and helpful. The arcade area and bathrooms were clean. We didn't eat here, only played the games for a good 4 hours. 
We had lots of fun.More,Each Member Of My Family Complained That The Food, Main Meals,Was Too Salty. The Only Thing We Enjoed Was The Appetizer. Dissapointed. PLAY AREA ON THE OTHER HAND WAS A FUN TIME.,Arrived at approximately 7pm for dinner on a Thursday night.  Slid through the pile of grease and fries that sat on the dining room floor for the first 30 minutes of our visit.  Noted the lack of customers in the dining area which allowed for...plenty of time for the Staff to clean up the fries, but no, they must have been showing off how good the food looked.  See the picture.  

We were taken to a table between two other groups though there were only 4 tables of people in the entire place, so we requested another table.  The 2nd table was across from the bar with high tables and chairs, much too high for one of the members of our party to sit.  I then requested another table from the bartender who told me to go back to the hostess.  Instead of doing that, we chose our own table.  

The waitress started out very nice and informative, but from there it went downhill. I ordered a mixed drink not on the menu that should have had 1 oz of Chambord, 1 oz of Frangelico and 2 oz of cream.  It appeared to have a bottom layer of Frangelico and 6-8 oz. of Cream.  Without drinking the drink, I returned it and said it should be in a short glass, not a glass I would get a milkshake in.  The second drink came out and appeared to be all Cream.  Didn't even taste the drink and just returned it.

My friend and I both ordered the thai chicken salad and the dried out chicken were overly singed and just tasted burnt from the grill marks.  The salmon was ok and plentiful.   Only towards the end of dinner were we asked if everything was ok and forget about getting my water glass refilled.  We had to chase the waitress down for salt and pepper a couple of times because we could not get pepper out of the pepper shaker.

After dinner we visited the bathroom.  The women's room had water covering the sink area, clogged toilets, and toilet paper on the ground.  I was so disgusted I didn't even want to sit on a toilet.  The men's room sink looked like it had been in a construction zone.  It too had clogged toilets and toilet paper on the ground.  See the picture.

Needless to say the place was disgustingly dirty, the Service was poor, and the food left much to be desired.  Take my advice even with discount coupons, don't waste your time and money on a visit.More,It was fun, food is good, service ok , average  over all , nothing fancy, you could spend lots of money, very easily and fast ,,We sat in the actual restaurant (separate area from the playrooms) and I have to say it was a very nice atmosphere; I was pleasantly surprised. There are TV's throughout the dining area, similar to a sports bar type place and it was clean. They...were short-staffed that night but the wait staff were nice. The food was pretty good, I got the Thai chicken salad and my daughter got the mac-n-cheese and the presentation was nice (I forgot to take pics!)....So on to the game room...it was Friday night and quite busy as you can imagine. The games are pricey so I would suggest checking Groupon for any deals. The other thing is, you will smell weed at certain points and it's obvious!More,Went to spend the day with the family.  Purchased a game card from Groupon.  There were a lot of arcade games out of order and the arcade is showing its age.  We will not be going back there better options around.  Also, if you get...food expect slow service.More,I could have went home and cooked faster and the place was empty. When we finally got food all the fries were dropped at the foot of the table.also we had to as manager cleaning up fries for silverware.  I would say pass this place...by. Plenty of other choices. If you really want D&B head 20 minutes west to Plymouth meeting Mall and enjoy.More,We were happy to find this one closer so we didn't have to drive into Philadelphia.  We arrived close to when it opened and had the place almost to ourselves for first half of our visit.  Theyoung lady working the front area where you get...your cards and add credits to them was a great.  She was full of smiles and friendly and helpful.  The place was clean and other staff members we encounter were friendly.  I liked that it was attached to Franklin Mills so you can walk out and go shopping if you want.  This was one of last family hurrahs before our oldest left for college so thank you for the fun times and happy memories!  There was something for everyone to enjoy along with so many choices.  I think the 4 way air hockey game was one of our favorites!  Since it was early we decided not to buy any food or drinks so cannot comment on them.More,Came for my son's 14th birthday celebration. It was a Sunday night around 6pm. The restaurant side of the establishment was relatively quite maybe 15 (possibly less)tables tops that had people. Came in received a table no problem. Our waitress came out and took our...drink menus. We chatted with her for a while. 10 minutes later our drinks (we ordered nothing complicated, 2 waters, 1 coke & 1 alcoholic beverage) came out with a different waitress. We asked if our previous waitress didn't like us anymore and the girl stated that she needed a table to serve. We placed our orders. While we waited for dinner two of our four drinks needed replenishing. 20 minutes goes by....our old waitress passed us by at least 4 times-said nothing to us. I stated before that there was really nobody in the restaurant that night. After waiting 25 minutes and nobody coming by to check on us...we left. How absolutely rude can this place be. All I wanted was a nice time out with my son. We felt like we were not wanted. Will not be coming back here.More,Great place for the whole family. Pretty good food, billiards, bowling and arcades. We went on a weeknight, so it was not crowded at all. It is pretty price though - the arcade games take 6-8 ""tokens"" on average - Ski-ball was 3 ""tokens"". After...you blow though your ""tokens"" - $ on an arcade card, you can redeem your tickets for prizes. But unless you have 700 plus tickets, you are just getting bouncy balls, and the cheep plastic hand clappers, kazoos, etc. They don't have a lot of variety at the lower end.More,Stopped in with the family for dinner. Trying to get a table in the game room can be a challenge if it's busy. Kids loved the games. Gamea are kind of pricey but exited it to be.  Some Games offer tickets for prizes. Good was...pretty good but staff was not attentive.More,Group outing. Bowling lanes didnt work. Food was ok.  Waitress Service and Bartender were very good.  Beer was cold.",A robot arm with a square face takes the cup & pour coffee. I expected a barista robot.,
"Food was great.  Portion size was more than adequate.  It was so refreshing to have such a good server.  Our server, Rebecca, was top notch.  I highly recommend that if you intend to eat here you get a reservation.  The place was packed.,Based upon a recommendation stopped for lunch The food was O.K. but nothing memorable. Large. Also includes a pretty good retail wine bottle selection.,Recently Lynn and I joined 4 of our friends for dinner at Cooperâ__s Hawk. It was our first visit. If you go, be sure to have a reservation. Cooperâ__s Hawk is a very busy, but very good restaurant. The ceilings are high. The restaurant can...be very noisy. Wine tastings are done at the mammoth bar.  There must have been at least 50 people doing tastings while we were there. Cooperâ__s AmHawk served there own wine.  I had Saraâ__s Baramundi which was a beautiful white fish ($29). It wax delicious and cooked to perfection.  Lynn and I shared there Brussels Sprouts Salad which was also very good.  This was. Very elegant experience.More,Had a leaving party for 9 people. We were told we would have to have two tables. You canâ__t put tables together for 9 people? I would understand if it was 29. Went somewhere else and got what we wanted. They got two very muscular...men to move one table to the end of another table and voila table for 9!More,As a member, I have tried to host my company's holiday season party for two years now. The event's coordinator is unwilling to book 16 people at one or multiple tables close together on a Friday or Saturday night. Pass on this establishment if you...are wanting to bring friends or work colleagues for a gathering. Disappointing at best.More,The staff was excellent, friendly and informative.  The wine, mediocre at best.  Similarly the food and over priced. The chicken overcooked and greasy. The fish sandwich was overwhelmed with dressing and bread.,Food has always been good, no matter what I ordered. Staff is friendly and attentive. This is just a well-run establishment. Not cheap, but worth what they charge. An atmosphere where you can show up wearing nice clothes if you like, and a place i...would NOT wear flip flops and beach attire.More,This is a good eaterie with some delicious items on the menu. My little granddaughter surprised us with an immediate request for lobster bisque...and she really liked it. Good service.  I don't think you'll regret eating at this establishment. If you want to go lite,...order a favorite appetizer and a main entree and share.More,Nice atmosphere, great food and great service. We stopped in for lunch without a reservation and they were able to accommodate us. We had a flight of wine and lunch. Our choices were perfect. Flatbread was tasty, the toppings were great and the bread was...crispy. The Brussels sprout salad and turkey burger were also very good. Service was pleasant.More,Our waiter, Cullen, was outstanding! Even though we had gift cards, he delivered top notch service. My tea was always filled and he remembered my daughterâ__s preference for no ice in her water. He is a major asset!

My hubby and daughter enjoyed the monthly...special, filet medallions with marscipone ravioli while I had my fav , Parmesan encrusted shrimp,scampi. We followed these treats with wonderful chocolate torte and cr_¨me br_»l_©e. Hubby and daughter split a bottle of the regular Cooperâ__s Hawk Cabernet Sauvignon.

This is one of if not the favorite restaurant for us. I recommend calling for a dinner reservation. They are often difficult to obtain.More,My daughter took me to this restaurant for lunch today. We were seated promptly on arrival. Server was there quickly, and drink orders were taken.
Their menu is extensive, and everything sounded wonderful. It took us a while to decide what to have. Everyone enjoyed...their entrees and appetizers. Food was great and I totally enjoyed by Flight of wine!More,Not what I expected at all, do not understand the high reviews. First, letâ__s start with the wine tasting. They use the same glass for every taste they give you, which is in no way proper when tasting wine. By the end of my tasting...they all tasted the same. We did not join the wine club.  Now to the food, the Brussels sprout appetizer is good but could do without the cream sauce drizzle on top and the extra sweetness added. We ordered the Parmesan encrusted shrimp scampi for our entrees , the shrimp itself was good but the capellini was served with a very greasy red sauce that tasted awful. Scampi should be a garlic sauce. Server was ok but overall not impressed, prefer a family owned restaurant over chains, chain restaurants do not have the same care and love given to a privately owned restaurant. Most likely will not return.More,Not impressed at all with the management here. We went on a Tuesday at 3:30 pm and did not have a reservation.  We were told that high tops in the bar were first come first serve but booths were reservation only as was any table...in the main area of the restaurant and without a reservation there was a 30-45 minute wait.  Luckily we were able to grab a four top in the bar which was the only table clean and open.  When we sat down there was one booth open and cleaned and within 5 minutes two other booths opened up.  The incredible thing was that all tables and booths that opened up around us stayed dirty and cluttered with food for the entire time we were there. We stopped counting how many times several different managers walked by without taking care of these dirty tables. No wonder there was such a wait! No one wanted to clean the tables so new customers could be seated. 
When it came to the food it was pretty average. Itâ__s a plus that they have a Lite and Fit menu . My salmon was good - a bit overdone but not to the point of sending it back. My husbands chicken dish was also overdone and pretty dry.  His side was pretty laughable- he substituted sliced potatoes for the fries and got 4 skinny little slices of potato. Really ? Each of our friends had a different experience. One loved her chicken dish with grilled broccoli and the other got an over done, greasy chicken sandwich with ice cold French fries. We thought that by going early enough we would get a decent table with good service. Unfortunately that was not the case. Management needs to focus on running the restaurant and not standing around checking their cell phones.  Very disappointingMore,We had a reservation for six and we were seated right on time.  Wait staff showed up promptly.  Drink orders were taken and tasty pretzel bread was delivered.  We were given ample time to  chat and  check the menu. There was no rush, which we...really liked. Meals  were delivered and the presentation was very nice.  They have a nice selection of entrees and some items did seem a bit pricey.  The wine list is extensive from their own Illinois winery.  Only complaint was with the Jambalaya.  Had plenty of shrimp . but the Andouille Sausage, you had to search for since it was very small diced pieces ( I guess for the flavoring),  The chicken pieces looked like strips of lunch meat instead of the normal pieces of breast meat  cubes.  OK, with that said, the dish was still very good and very well seasoned (sorry, I am spoiled after living in Louisiana).  No complaints on any of the other dishes.  Portions are large, come hungry.  The wine bare looks like a  great place to come and unwind.  A wall to wall selection of wines to please anyone s taste.More,This new Cooper's Hawk location is great. The wine tasting bar was fun and the staff are very friendly. I also enjoy they clearly know their stuff and can give you some interesting insight into the wines. After the tasting, we went to the dining...room for lunch. Our waiter was was great, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is perfect. 

This is a good spot to go on a date or a girls night out. I'd also recommend their wine club if you plan to visit at least once a month since the tastings are included.More","Yeah, full sentences please, I am not a robot ok??_?.. so I felt bad?_?... to be clear, you don?_?t need to be a robot, it?_?s not rocket science, you are a server I",
"Popped in here for lunch on a whim, and so glad I did! Service was prompt, and both the sushi and noodle dishes I had were well presented and tasted superb. Quality of the food would put much more expensive eateries to shame. Well worth...visiting!More,As an Archway local, I frequent this place often. Thereâ__s a fantastic range of sushi, curries, noodles, soups and starters which never fail to hit the spot - always at such a fantastic price! Service is always friendly and fast, making it a joy to...visit and eat in as opposed to taking away. Would 100% recommend for anyone visiting the area!More,The food is so nice and tasty
I like coming here lunch dinner but it is a nice place to visit I hope you get more customers
Thank you so much,The food is nice 
And I enjoy so much 
I like to come every weekend 
Because stuff a nice to me I hope you guys will be Busy over Christmas,We love this little restaurant. We haven't done the full menu but I can highly recommend any of their sushi dishes and especially the Soya based noodle soup. The noodle dishes are also incredibly tasty and Mooreish. They also make the sushi to your specific...order in case you don't want certain ingredients, and they never let you down. I really like this restaurant, the chef is so lovely and has accommodated many (young)  fussy eaters who have been amongst us in the past.  Friendly staff, very accommodating, and prior to lockdown, a lovely chilled atmosphere to eat in. A little haven on Junction Road.More,Some of the best sushi we've ever had. Been getting the takeaway for years, never disappointed. We've eaten in a couple of times as well and it's always been speedy and tasty. Thank you!,Ordered takeaway and was very unimpressed. Gyoza and Takoyaki were cold, Yaki soba was tasteless. The beef ramen was also very poor for what it cost. Overall, not good Japanese food at all. First review I have ever posted on Tripadvisor; it was that bad....Avoid.More,Very poor. I specifically ordered without fish eggs but this order note was ignored twice. When I called the restaurant she said it was an uber eats problem and that I should have called even though it gave me a tick box option to select...seasame seeds rather than fish eggs. I also wrote it in the order notes and it was completely ignored. I asked for a replacement and they refused. I asked to complain and the refused too. Absolutely disgusting. I will be speaking to food standards regarding allergen misrepresentation. I now cannot eat any of as it's all squashed together in a small box.More,Ordered the standard edamame and the beef Don. Both delicious. The beef in the beef Don was cooked perfectly (red in the middle) which surprised me, as most places cook beef until brown all the way through.

They catered to my request (sort of intolerance)...to onions, and were perfectly happy to make sure they used entirely separate equipment and surfaces

No picture as I got half way through before realising I needed to leave a review it was so good!

I'm staying nearby for another night and will probably go againMore,Centrally located, nice flavour, something different than Chinese & Indian. Not very heavy. Enjoyed with lager.,Always had very kind, friendly customer service here! I have ordered from here online 20+ times - and in person multiple times when I lived in the area. Run by friendly people of colour and I can see that the staff all get along which...makes for a comfortable dining environment. I can see the hygiene standards in practice from the ordering counter. The ambiance is slightly elevated from that of a simple takeaway as there are dining tables and a bathroom, however it is not lavish - cheap and cheerful.

Always order chicken katsu with chilli oil. Maybe a side of tori karaage - juicy and delicious - with spicy mayo. I'm addicted! Sometimes sashimi. Not often sushi.. they always get the katsu PERFECT, large portion, lots of chicken, potatoes. They always listen to any side requests I have for napkins. They separate cold and hot food into different bags.

If you order at a busy time the potato may be a bit undercooked/ katsu chicken a bit crunchier than usual - but this has happened to me only ONCE!More,One my new favourites in the area! Fresh fish,wonderfully prepared and tasty as sushi can be. Lovely family that run this place. Havent tried any of the hot dishes yet but Iâ__m sure they are as good as the sushi.
Highly recommend,Seriously expensive and generally awful in summary....

Presentation sucks. 

Quality sucks

Chicken old and dry

Tastes foul 

Just donâ__t bother,Ordered a takeaway from this place and received the wrong order. When I called to let them know they just blamed me for ordering it wrong in a rude abrupt manner. I even had the receipt which didnâ__t match my order and when I told...them, they said that the receipt is wrong. They just slammed the phone down on me without a solution, refund or apology. Terrible customer service and wonâ__t be going again.More,I ordered delivery from here and was left incredible disappointed and hungry. We ordered  a selection of hot and cold dishes and it was consistently inedible. The sushi rice was soggy and wet, the tuna measly and fishy and the hot dishes were cold. I...rang the restaurant and was offered as compensation a 20% coupon off my next order!!! No replacement dishes and no apology - as I wouldn't order from here again, nor recommend anyone to do so ever, a discount voucher is totally useless to me. Stay away - this is one in a number of terrible reviews! All food went in the bin!More", What's super cool about this is that your order comes out of the kitchen to your booth via robotic tray that rides on its own track above the revolving sushi choices.,
"pricey for mediocre roast pork and milk tea. I would only come here if I have no other choice in the area and when Joy Hing is closed,This chain restaurant serves good roast pork. So if you are looking to sample the famous  Cantonese style roast meats, this is worth a visit.

You will also find other popular teahouse food (eg beef horfun) served here.,The roast pork had very crispy skin. But the fat layer below it was too thick according to my opinion because I ate one which has thin layer of fat only. Overall the roast pork is the selling point. The goose was ok only. so...so.More,This is a chain restaurant and not bad quality if you don't have much time and want to eat quickly.  Noodles, rice plates, BBQ items, vegetables.,Went here for lunch twice! Beautiful roasted pork which was very cheap. Only problem was the language barrier in the restaurant, it was very authentic Hong Kong.,Tai Hing is one of the better established restaurants specialising in bbq and roasted meat. But I go there for their roast goose (siew ngo in cantonese). Wanted to Order the goose thigh (price at hkd 90) but was enticed by the waitress to get...the lower quarter plus the prized thigh for HKD 120.
The taste was excellent and the accompanying sauce and chilli brought the taste up another notch. 
The layer of fat below the skin literally melts in the mouth. 
One restaurant that will be on my return list. Unfortunately its a sinful indulgence both to your health as well as your pocket.More,The restaurant was nice and clean, with the waiters wearing uniforms.

We liked the roast pork on a bed of rice with their soy sauce, served with a plate of Choi sum with oyster sauce.

My husband picked the mixed roast platter which consisted of...roast pork, bbq pork, chicken, sausage, beef shank and squid, and ordered this with a bowl of rice. 

They donâ__t serve alcoholic drinks but do give complimentary flask of hot water (compared to other establishments which just give you a cup of cold water).  The utensils drawer was well equipped with chopsticks, cutlery drawer, conidements and paper napkins.

Liked this small cosy restaurant and would return.More,We stopped by for dinner one night and the food was really good. Tried to order an extra chicken leg as a side and was told they were out of chicken legs?  The staff was a bit confused and overwhelmed, but the food was good.,This restaurant specializes in roast meats, goose, duck, chicken and pork. It is delicious, especially the chicken rice and it comes with a side dish of green veg of your choice of 2 different vegetable and a small bowl of chicken broth for HKD $60...which is about AUD$11. 
We dined here for lunch and dinner, in the 4 days that we stayed in HK.More,My wife and I visited Tai Hing as part of one of the restaurants we experienced as part of our Kowloon Food Tour through Urban Adventures. Tai Hing is located at Shop 66, Parkes Street, Jordan (Kowloon).

As a group of 8, we split up...into two tables and ordered two meat dishes which included the char sui pork and the crispy pork belly, and a side of rice to share.  The restaurant is famous for its crispy pork belly and peking goose and luckily for us being a weeknight, they hadn't run out of the pork belly. The other table also ordered the peking goose. Between the three of us it cost 150HKD (approx. $25 Australian). 

This restaurant is very popular and busy.

Overall, the food was excellent and worth a visit when in Kowloon.More,First, this review is of the Tai Hing branch in portland st mong kok,HK.

The char siew (bbq pork) $60 hkd the portion was literally 8 tiny pieces and NOT what was shown in the picture menu.it was literally 1/4 of what was pictured. 
The...2nd time we went we ordered this again and this time got the portionshown in the menu which was 3x the amount recieved on our first visit.
Same thing happened with the choy sum vegetable dish approx $35 hkd. The first time we got the rip off tiny portion. The second visit we got the normal portion which was double the portion received the first visit.
The steamed grouper fillets with pumpkin @$98 hkd was again a rip off portion with 6 tiny pieces of fish which were not fillets but pieces cut near fins and bone (first visit)
Ling with brocolli @$78hkd was had on each visit and the porition was advertised and the same on each visit.
Fish maw zand chicken in pepper soup @ $72 hkd was a decent portion as was the egg plant/mince pork/salt fish clay pot (both had on visit 2)
Seafood/tofu clay pot @$78 was a decent portion (1st visit).
Overall food quality was good with authentic cantonese flavors and style.
Service was average.
We returned because the mong kok location was convenient and the food was good but we were disappointed to discover the small portions for tourist rip off that happned to us on the first visit. If this had not occurred i would rate this place a solid 3 stars.More,We ordered roasted goose, suckling pig rice and duck soup with rice. The food is good. Roasted goose is very tender (but not just ok in terms of flavor). Suckling pig is tender with great amount of fat + meat ratio. Duck herbal soup is...great, big serving, and the duck is very tender as well.More,Since morning 7 am open , you can Taste yummy roast duck , pig , Hainan chicken , the quality is good enough among similar resteraunt ; at night time they offer spicy fish , beef and some other fried dishes that lunch is not...available . They are many same resteraunt at some another location both in Hong Kong and Kowloon , also they have a branch store in Hong Kong airport near by gate 40 , if you have long eating time in airport , thatâ__s the nice quick lunch place should try .More,Good place for Chinese bbq duck and pork. Good for quick bite lunch , dinner or afternoon tea. Local places you might need to share table during peak hours. A lot of other choices of local favorite foods too. They have a lot of locations...which have similar food quality, so itâ__s safe to drop by any one. I think they call this the Hong Kong style cafe.More,This restaurant was near my hotel in Jordan area. The food was average, nothing to shout about. However I would give good praise to the service. The waiter was polite and patient with me and my family and we could decide on what to eat....The food didn't take too long to come. While the food was not great but the experience was pleasant.More",There is a mini robot talking to you :) the cafe itself is modern with white stylish decor like something from the jetsons and even a talking robot (he spoke japanese so there wasnt much to say...,
"Absolutely loved everything here. The hot Turkish hummous is.a standout! We were there on a Wednesday night which is apparently  $10 bottle of wine night - lucky us! Our server Jack was wonderful, outside seating great, just wished we had had room for dessert.,This was our first time in Reyla. Our very knowledgeable, experienced server, Casey
advised that the norm was to order 3-5 small plates between us. We chose 4 excellent dishesâ__Turkish hummus served with veg (nice touch) and pita for dipping; the most incredible zucchini flowers,...a wonderful beet dish, and lastly octopus with a unique dried fruited topping and wonderful sauces. All dishes were beautifully prepared, with interesting, tasty accompaniments. The space is lovely, with comfy seating; 
our server explained each dish. Between the beautiful food, professional service and the ambienceâ_¦this restaurant is a winner.More,First time in Asbury Park, first time at Reyla but not the last. This restaurant should be your FIRST choice if you are anywhere in the area. We were amazed with the dishes we selected. The flavors were complex and beautifully balanced. The food POPPED...visually and the tastes can not be described in words. Please, just go to Reyla and try it. We had the Artichokes, the Shakshuka, and the star by far: the Octopus. Service was spot on, the atmosphere vibrant (I like that comment by Ray M.), and the cost very reasonable. Don't take my word on this one, go and see for yourself. We will be back.More,The food was amazing.  Between the two of us, we had three dishes (two appies and one main) and were incredibly satisfied.  Take a peek at my photos to see our choices.  The ingredients were fresh, the the flavors were delectable, the textures (for instance...in the mahumada) were ideal and the presentations were beautiful works of art.  

I was surprised that the only night that dessert is served is on Thursday night, which is, ""date night"".  Okay, not only surprised, but dissappointed, too.  

The wait staff was very kind.  She admitted that she was very new.  She did her best and I commend her.  I'd advise the staff have a better understanding of the food, by trying each (or most) of the dishes.  Again, as sweet as this new staff was, she did not know the different dishes.  I am understanding and compassionate.  Some others may not be!  I am also aware that during these times, staff don't stay around for long, and finding committed staff who know the foods can be a challenge.  

The value was good.  If in the area, I will be sure to visit again!More,A+ experience. Food was fantastic. Service was excellent. Staff was friendly and helpful. Lex was our server and she was awesome.  She helped us with the menu and made us feel welcome with her warm personality,The small plate/tapas/sharing menu has multiple creative options. Our favorites include Turkish Hummus and Green Falafel. The Money in the Banana Stand cocktail was different and delicious. The room is comfortable and the service is attentive. We will return!,Went here to celebrate a birthday which the staff was made aware of multiple times when we were seated. The new ordering platform via smartphone is a great idea, but bugs need to be worked out, such as a reliable WIFI in the restaurant since...cell phone service is weak. This caused  undue anxiety as we had to input multiple credit cards which the system stated were declined, only for us to receive pre-authorization notifications on our devices. A lot of quality time wasted looking for the correct drinks, as an example the draft beers the server named were not listed nor were certain other drinks with no provision to write them in as far as we could see. Waitress took over our ordering, but wait staff became overwhelmed as the night unfolded due to the level of business, presumably since the management assumed they could get by with less staff and rely on the online ordering system which was failing them.  As far the food, the quality was good and we wanted to love it,  but even understanding the ""small plates"" concept the menu was limited and not varied enough for our taste. Also, for the quantity of food received, the value was just not there. Finally, our birthday guest never received acknowledgement of her special day as others around did. Disappointing for a regular client whom chose this spot to introduce us to the concept. Hopefully management can work on these negatives and improve on them to make the experience memorable.More,We had a fantastic meal at Reyla which offers indoor and outdoor dining.  The place is located right in the heart of the very cool restaurant district.

The menu id geared more for vegetarian than meat but everything is good.  And we pretty much ordered...everything over the course of a long dinner with friends.

The staff is super friendly.

The d_©cor is hip and clean with a definite European feel.

The portions were fairly large and the prices were reasonable.

The drink menu was excellent.

This is just a really nice and comfortable to eat and hang out.More,Excellent hummus with arbequina olive oil, the wings were perfectly seasoned, and the beef with the salad ( spicy) was great,The outdoor seating was excellent, and the service very good. The vegan options were just so- so. The portobello was kind of tasteless, and the lettuce wrap was too spicy. Nice portion of wine for the price.More,Hi there, Thank you for taking the time to leave this review. Since we are working on improving our overall experience every day we would like to learn more about your recent visit with us. Can you please send me an email to carolyn@culturehg.com to...More,Horrible experience.  We are frequent visitors to Asbury and have never had such an odd (to say the least) experience.  We were a party of two.  After ordering and being served, we started eating and we both had to use the restrooms.  We both got...up from the table and when we returned the food was removed from the table, a pair of eyeglasses was missing and the screen on a cell phone that was left on the table was completely shattered.

We asked to speak with the manager and we did.  I do not recall her name.  She said she had the glasses and returned them, but could not explain the cell phone issue.  We were told they would review the cameras and get back to us.  The woman took our information and that was it.  We never got a call or anything back.  How does a business operate like this?  I myself have owned a business and I just can not get over the poor service.  It was completely ignored.  Let's just say we will never be coming back there and a poor review will for sure be put on every possible place.

Horibble, Horrible.  I see this restaurant closing very soon because of this type of experience.More,Hi Laurie,
I am so happy I was able to speak with you personally and resolve this matter. We hope you will change your review upon your next visit. We appreciate your business and we look forward to seeing you again soon.

-Angelo,Friday night in the summer.  Asbury park dinner plans.   decide to try  reyla.   2 people.   hostess says there only few ahead of us so we decide to get on the list @7:20.   the hostess said it should be 30 minutes at most.   i didn't have...too much faith in the hostess so my wife and I went in to avon and just finished our dinner when we received the text that out table was ready for us.   it was 9:00.   ha !More,Hi - Thank you for your feedback during your recent visit to REYLA. We understand your experience was frustrating and we apologize for that. We have shared this review with our staff and director of operations, Angelo, who would like to reach out personally to...More,Even though we accidentally booked out reservation for wrong day,staff was gracious and accommodated us promptly.

We hope to see you again soon.,We enjoyed the Cozy Cardigan, Rich & Powerful and a Boulevardier.  We also liked the Moussaka, Green Bangers and Falafel. We like the modern twist on these classics.  Nice atmosphere and great service from the bartender.,Hey Kickie, Thanks for this awesome review. Looks like you had quite the spread and we are happy you enjoyed it! We hope to see you again soon!,the term â__tries too hardâ__ comes to mind.  good cocktails, but otherwise...  we were not feeling it at all.  food ranged from weird to bad.  and we both got a bad stomach ache from it.  would not recommend, unfortunately."," We will not return to this restaurant while there is a Robot serving.

"I found this place because of trip advisor. We went planning to just have a few drinks but ended up eating also. If our trip was t cut short we would have gone back again! My husband loved the beers, he was really impressed. Food...was great too. The guys behind the bar were friendly and helpful also.More,If you are looking for a friendly welcome and good craft beer in the madness that is Kabukicho, Mugi No Oto makes for a great break.

"Running around Omote-sando can leave you pretty starving and this place can hit the spot for basic fish nigiri. The staff are friendly with excellent English and the joint is jumping. Pricing is per plate on the conveyor belts running from $4-7/dish. You can also...order off the menu. Two people around $30 or so. Again, not the greatest, but you're in and out in as fast as you can say Heiroku. Beer and beverages available, but the free Hot water/green tea is nice touch. Good luck and enjoy!More","We liked the ambiance very much and the robot server! One round came by the robot waiter, which we'd never had before, so that was a bonus experience!More,Dear GoPlaces622353, we are super glad to learn your experience was a positive one and extremely",
"Wish I could give a zero.
Avoid by all meansâ_¦ complicated system to order. Got served twice the wrong drink and never saw my food, ran out of timeâ_¦. Took half hour to get the first wrong coffee. Will contest the charges.,We were a large group of people and we placed lunch orders to both Abbruzzo and Riviera. With Riviera the experience was awful. With Abbruzzo service was quick, food was good but not worth the price. Our feeling is that they take huge advantage of...us being captive in the terminal to offer super expensive meals.More,My credit card was rejected four times, so i figured i would eat somewhere else. i get all the way home to find that $400 WORTH OF charges went through on my card anyway. THEY MUST NO THE FOOD WASNT GIVEN TO ANYONE. I am...disgusted because there is no way to contact the company as they have no contact info on their websites.More,Avoid this place, you are forced to pay for your meal + tips ( for a horrible service & rude wait staff).  wait time for a salad & grilled chicken sandwich is 45 minutes!!, i guess it takes 45 minutes to serve a burnt chicken....you are better of at a McDonalds.More,Food expensive and as far as the grilled chicken sandwich,skip them.burgerâ__s done and dry, chicken is tiny and microwaved . However drinks while overpriced ( Manhattan and Aperol spritz) very good but small) and $40 for both.,Do not waste your time. After waiting forever for our food, we could barely eat it because it tasted so bad. It was definitely the worst breakfast I have ever had in my life. Go anywhere else.,Poor service, high prices. The food was ok. iPads did not work; had to use the one on next table. Didnâ__t like to interfered with the people next door. Weâ__ll look for something else next time.,Itâ__s SO awful and un-human to have to order everything via an iPad and then have a kid bring you your beer in a plastic cup with a lid on it. Thereâ__s absolutely NOTHING attractive about this robotic service and I honestly hope they find...a way to re-invent the convenience factor to include decent Heyman interaction and SERVICEMore,Poor service and with an attitude in spite of the high prices. Ten dollar warm beer is available. Waitress states that refrigerator does  ot cool much. Do not waste your time.,I had a burger here and it was probably one of the worst ever. Dry (old?) Bun with a more or less tasteless beef patty.The fries were good and service ok.,Amazing food. Incredible considering itâ__s in Newark Airport. We had the Amatriciana and the lamb chops. Both were delicious. Best meal Iâ__ve ever had in an airport. If youâ__re in Terminal C make sure to eat here. Youâ__ll b very happy,The menu is on a pad so you order off that - no service from the ""server"".  The first words from the ""server"" were, ""Did you order?""  No greeting, no offer of a glass of water, just ""Did you order?""  ""Yes, I did.""  ""What did...you order?""  ""Salmon and broccoli.""  He walked off.  10 minutes later I flagged him down to get a glass of water.  The lady next to me ordered the same and I had to ask the ""server"" 15 minutes later to bring her a glass of water.  She ordered a glass of wine and was told 10 minutes later they didn't have it so she ordered another, and was told in another 10 minutes that wasn't available either.  By this time, she'd finished her lunch and had to leave to catch a plane.  She tried to see the manager on the way out but he was taking a complaint from another customer.  The couple with one daughter ordered two sandwiches to share.  When they arrived, both the husband and wife gagged at the taste and immediately told the daughter, ""Don't touch that!"" and sent it back.  When I left 25 minutes later, their second order still hadn't arrived.  My salmon was overcooked and the broccoli was several days old before they ""cooked"".  The black lentils under the salmon were cooked maybe 3 minutes and can only be described as ""chewy"".  Between the service, price - $71.00 for the salmon and broccoli - I will NEVER return.  The restaurant used to be OK but it is in the sub-basement right now.More,Stopped for breakfast cause sitting in the terminal is like a noisy zoo. Attractive look to the restaurant. Sat at the bar. Ordering on the tablet there is rather easy. Food came out quick. Basic eggs bacon toast was fine, nothing wrong, nothing exceptional. Of...course quite pricy compared to a non-airport setting, but they didnâ__t mind me taking my time and watching some tv while drinking the coffee. Not sure Iâ__d go back, as there were other copycat places within a 5-10 min walk. But overall fine.More,We had two and a half hours to spare, and the restaurant was near to our outgoing gate, so it seemed very welcoming.The waiter was very helpful, as the restaurant had ordering on line (not my scene) so he did the ordering for us.. We...had a shared starter and some french fries, and two glasses of wine and he did the tip on the computer.I never saw the order or the total  cost and  the receipt was sent to my email address.Guess what the bill came to $90. Rather costly but what can you expect in an airport and  in the States.We certainly stayed a long time in our seats !!!!More,The taste of burnt chicken and burnt toast is indelibly etched in my mind. Yes I was refunded.  Did this help ameliorate the memory? Not much.  I am sure I was unlucky but how do you put out burnt food to customers?","Robots, robots, robots.",
"We chanced upon this conveyor belt sushi shop and got drawn in by the long queue. Although the queue is long, it moves pretty quickly and we got seats within 10-15 mins. The raw seafood is very fresh and the serving size is huge. The...sushi are all bursting with toppings, they are very generous. The price is also very reasonable and I highly recommend to give this shop a try!More,Definitely worth going if youâ__re in the vicinity. Delicious sushi in a cute mall. You wonâ__t be disappointed.,Nice fresh sushi.  You can pick plates with sushi already made off the conveyor belt going around or fill out a sheet to order exactly what you wish.  Pictures and numbers make it easy to order regardless of whether you speak Japanese.   Did not see...desert here but plenty of good options only a few feet away.More,Back again, for the fourth time! Before leaving on a cruise from port, we just had to have another visit to this sushi restaurant and this time bringing some of our family members with us. We all enjoyed our sushi feast here and stuffed ourselves...silly with all the varieties of sushi revolving in front of us. There was a line but not too bad at the end of Golden Week and we felt lucky to be able to dine here again. Will be back in November for another cruise. Looking forward for another round of sushi here.More,Reasonable price with fat fat fish. Would be amazed by the taste of fish, which melted with no try in mouth. Try if possible!!!,Very friendly staffs to kids.  Very fresh sushi.  Reasonable price.  Comfortable sitting.  What else do you need?  I will definitely go back.,I'm pretty picky when it come to sushi unlike my family. It was the freshest and tasty. The have a great variety and it didn't disappoint. We waited around 30-40 minutes on a Friday mid-afternoon. There were 7 of us and they managed to sit...us together. Service was great even with their limited English. We definitely felt welcomed.More,Thank you for post of your experience on TripAdvisor.

MiuraMisaki-kou World Porters Manager Masaki Tomoyama,We came by three times during our last trip to Japan in July when we were in Yokohama for our Princess cruise. On the evening of our arrival we were too late and they were closing down, so we left disappointed. Went back on the...second day for dinner and we all had a good time enjoying all the varieties of sushi there. Everything was fresh and the chefs were very friendly and accommodating. There was no line when we first got there but the line soon built up. The wait staff was welcoming and friendly and they speak some English so it was not as intimidating as going to some non-English speaking restaurants. Spacious and comfortable seating made this revolving sushi place enjoyable. Prices reasonable. When we came back to port on turnaround day, we went there again for lunch and had another wonderful meal. This is THE place to be when in Yokohama!More,Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your experience.

"Wok is terible. The worst I ever have. 
Staff is arogant and rude. Not really the best ending of the night. And the waste of money.,Absolutely brilliant takeaway/sit in. Gorg noodles and the best chicken ever. 10/10. Will definitely come again. Actually I might get another later.,Visited on the 23rd of July 2020.

Ordered Pizza, Grilled Chiabata Sandwich and Vegetarian Wrap. Me and my partner was supposed to split the Chiabata Sandwich. 

I asked the girl working to split it. She just looked at me rude and said ""No No"". I...asked for a plastic knife to split it myself. She just went ""No no"" and looked away.

Food, especially the pizza, was actually good. Service was terrible. Looking at other reviews I understand them, they treat customers like garbage.

Of course I cannot recommend or visit again.

Of course we did not get a receipt..More,My daughter and I choose vegetarian wok and a vegetarian wrap and it was tasteless.. Not worth money.,This is a street-food type of restaurant offering very tasty meals at a normal price for a quick lunch.,Cold... robotic staff... no personality... no sense for real beings.. Did not happen once... will not go there ever.,Ok food but very loudy workers that curse a lot and so unfriendly to customers.
Been here 2 times and both of these times the worhers had the estrange with each other,My boyfriend had vegetables wok. It was so salted, that we couldn't feel another taste than salt with noodles. Seriously...we use a lot of salt on our food,but this was the most salted food I have ever eaten.
The sandwich bread seems to be made...by them, but it has a very hard crust, and it doesn't taste as good as it looks. 
The vegetables inside the sandwich tasted and smelled a little like fish. My boyfriend had to throw his sandwich.
And beside all of that, a blonde girl who is working there has a very bad, arrogant attitude. I asked about a thing from the menu what it was, because it was written in Croatian. I got the answer from a girl working there. I don't understand why the blonde girl felt the need to explain again, on an irritated tone, since I confirmed that I understood. She seemed in a hurry and stressed. Pity...More,Mr. Wok was a great choice for a quick dinner.  We ordered and actually took the food home, I saw that there is delivery available.  I liked that they were trying to do something different from the typical things you see on a Croatian menu....We got a couple of things off the menu and my favorite was the Prvi Poljubac.  Definitely will be going back the next time I am in Makarska.More,We have been in Makaraska for several days, eating out every night. After a while you get tired of the same food, same menues (even if the food is great). We skipped another restaurant dinner and got a wok called First Kiss at Mr Wok....This was a lovely change and the food was really good. A nice alternative if you are tired of pizza, pasta, sea food or steaks..More,Takeaway pizza & noodles both very good. Quick service & an excellent feta salad. Great street food on habourside location.,We are not very fans of sea food so this place was a real discoverment. Cheap, fast and really delicious food. This place is very clean and with an excellent sea view. Huge portions served.,We were recommended to Mr Wok by our Sail Croatia guide. We had the Mr Wok box and it was absolutely delicious, fast, fresh and filling. Great friendly staff and such a nice change of food. Thankyou",None,
"This place sells itself as being Italian, but the food was nothing like anything authentically Italian. A ravioli dish was DRENCHED in tomato sauce, the pasta utterly invisible, in a way you would never find in Italy. A steak with beurre ma_®tre d'h_´tel just had...a couple of slices of snail butter from a tube on it, nothing artisanal or home-made about. Panna cotta might have been alright but had a sweet manufactured syrup poured over it. Service was swift but very joyless, you really felt these people were just phoning it in to earn a living (like a lot of places, it's true). Stay away.More"," The robot is cute and helpful, but thought it was overkill when we asked for chilli, then they make the robot deliver just the sliced chill.",
not very nice place no smiles in Hawaii Maui thats for sure hardy coffee not ready and half there chic' over cooked or burned and the bento's dry and the rice to mushy, This restaurant boasts a robot that serves out your orders,
"Stopped in this Waffle House today as we saw they were open. Chris and Jesse were working and these two were amazing!!! Food was great and I highly recommend this Waffle House. We will visit whenever we are in town!!!,we in joy the waffle house fi i have the money to bey one i wood like to have a waffle house thank you,Walkable from campus.
Regular Waffle House fare except even nicer servers!  Very attentive.
Bathrooms a little icky but that isnt the draw.,Sit at the bar and be ready for a shw.  watch the breakfast being made - its fun.  The waffles are good, eggs perfect, grits good and the hash browns best scattered, covered and peppered.  But the key to having fun - doing look down...at the floor - if you do, you won't eat anymore....  Eyes up, have fun!More,I am so happy when I find a Waffle House as nice as this one!  Restaraunt is clean and staff is warm and friendly!  A great cup of coffee in the morning to wake up!  The usual breakfast foods are available, and I highly recommend...their pecan waffles!More,Waffle House is a great stop for a good cup of coffee, a nice hot plate of breakfast, and a hearty bowl of grits!,I've been to this Waffle House before, usually with my son because he loves a classic breakfast, and we have enjoyed it. It's Waffle House so we are not expecting 5-star dining. The service has usually been relaxed and friendly but this time it was...almost robotic. No bad but it didn't feel comfortable. So I'm trying to figure out if it was that the young man that waited on us was new - perhaps. He just seemed really awkward. It was all so serious and from what I could tell, the entire staff were like that. They didn't smile, including the person at the cashier. The food was actually fine but it makes you realize how much service counts in enjoying a meal.More,This Waffle House has a very welcoming atmosphere and staff.  Great service and always with a smile!  The food was just as I expected and remember.  Eggs, hash browns, and toast and coffee.  All served quickly and with a smile.,Great service and friendly southern hospitality. Fast Waffle House breakfast with good food. Ample parking with easy access to freeway and local shopping. Tasty grits, hash, and of course waffles!,Stayed at a local hotel and found this Waffle House close to our hotel.  An extremely well run and clean restaurant.  If there were awards for best breakfast restaurant this establishment should win
  Courteous staff and great manager. They even had apple butter for the...toast.  We have marked this for future trips through this area.More,Simple fare at this Waffle House with friendly service and excellent value for money.

I would happily use this restaurant again if travelling through.,If you are looking for a quick, greasy spoon type of joint, this is always a reliable spot. Service is quick and the food maintains your standard Waffle House fare. Always a good choice though for a late night breakfast!,My husband and I stumbled in for breakfast before getting on the road to Georgia. Excellent friendly and efficient service. We sat at the counter and Lisa took care of us. Clearly this is a favorite place with lots of regulars coming in and getting...greeted by name and even order. Husband had the sausage scramble bowl and I had the full breakfast. Juice serving was large and coffee was hot, fresh and perfect strength. The juice tasted like it came out of a carton (no harm in that). My husband's sausage bowl came over hash browns and with cheese - he enjoyed it and I tasted and the sausage was great and fresh tasting. The full breakfast included eggs, toast, bacon (or sausage), grits and a full waffle. The waffle was limp and only margarine and table syrup, so not a huge hit with me. But the rest was outstanding. I put syrup in the grits (a travesty in the south but I love it) for my sweet, eggs were perfect over easy and bacon freshly cooked (not day old reheated). I left full, even with only eating 1/4 of the waffle. The staff really hustles on the griddle - two people handled the whole breakfast service on the line.More,Waffle House is always the same - good food fast and at a good price.

This place is easy to miss because it is not the standard Waffle House building so you may drive right past it.

The bathrooms were in rough shape - could...use some bleach and a good scrub.More,Chain. Fairly clean. No rye toast option.  Coffee refills hard to obtain.  Robotic wait person. Eggs were cooked perfectly, however.  Nighthawks at the Diner vibe. Mediocre coffee.  Bright lights, small city.","Lights, dancing, robots, music, laser beams, creatures, motorised THiNgS, a bouncing horse, a man eating shark...",
"I was walking back to the hotel when I chanced upon this restaurant. It serves authentic Vietnamese food, such as Chicken Pho, which I had for dinner. It was tasty and its portion large enough. 

The evening I was there, the payment mode was only...cash, which thankfully, I had a little of. In fact, a gentleman walked out when he realised he did not carry cash on him. 

The service was non-intrusive and efficient.More,Ok bistro. The food was average, we had summer rolls and pho-bo, it was poorly seasoned, so we had to season the food by the seasoning available on our tables. ourselves. The service was kind and smiley, the interior was clean and  simple.,Good spring rolls a delicious Pho. Friendly personal and nice interier. Simple and plesant. Recomended durring the rainy day.,Not much to say about this place. I felt sorry for the staff who obviously did not want to be working here. Service was unfriendly and sullen."," The servers seem to be indifference about the job like robots, they only took the order and sever the food, they basically had no emotion.",
"La Terra Italiana is indeed an incredible place! I was there one week ago with some friends to enjoy some good food and drinks and we all were blown away by the pizzas. Its really like being in Naples. Besides the great dough (they make...their own as the pizza makers are actually Italians from Naples) also the creativity of the ingredients and toppings itâ__s remarkable so they can bring to a new modern something as classic and arguably simple as a pizza. The service is also great especially thanks to the always smiling young lady thatâ__s managing the reservations and Nico who is helpful and knowledgeable. Thanks very much guys, we will be back soon!More,Yesterday evening I went at La Terra Italiana with my wife and our brother and sister in law; we choose that place because of the recommendation of my brother, great expert of Italian food and especially pizzas, and we were not disappointed at all!!! Upon...arrival we were met and greeted by a very nice and smiley girl who took us at our table. Our drinks order was taken quickly and they arrived at our table in almost no time. The pizza is really, REALLY OUTSTANDING! I am Italian and have been eating (and comparing) pizzas since I was born and I am absolutely impressed with the quality of this one. Thanks to Niccol_², an Italian member of the staff that helped us greatly during the evening we got to know the dough proofed for 48 hours which makes it so soft and highly digestible. The quality of the ingredients is also very high, I had the Gemelli pizza, with Parma ham, grana and rucola and it all tasted like I was in Italy. My brother in law had the tagliata steak with truffle and he also was really happy with the quality of the meat and the preparation. We also went for dessert and coffee and all was outstanding. All in all we experienced a very enjoyable night out, great food and great service. Thanks to Niccol_² for looking after us so good and to the girls whose name I unfortunately donâ__t remember. We will definitely be back!!!More,Hello,
I have been 3 times in this restaurant. It's like a house made restaurant.Its pretty cosy.
I had a Pizza ,a Dessert and a Lasagne.I cook Italian food myself home and only go to restaurant in Zwolle on special occasion or wherever I can...afford it.
In general the quality is good. 
Would be nice if they open at day time as well.So far so good.More,Let's start at the beginning. Walking in the ambience was positive - warm and alive. That's really the only positive. The tables were so close together patrons had difficulty sitting down and the waitress had to squeeze sideways between chairs. There was no water on...the table, and when ordering a drink, water had to be purchased at twice the price of a glass of beer. The waitress refused to bring tap-water. 30 minutes later after asking where our meal was we were told the food order had not been placed with the kitchen. We were offered free bread as compensation. Free BREAD, which should have been included anyway as we ordered soup. To be fair there was one piece of bread in the Onion Soup, however the onion was crunchy and almost raw, so that stayed in the bowl. My wife ordered tomato soup, which looked and tasted like tinned tomatoes with a basil leaf floating on top. The pizza was a huge disappointment, ordered the 'carnivore' meat pizza. It had a few slices of pepperoni, very few pieces of mostly fat bacon and the whole lot was smothered with cold pastrami. It was barely edible, a fair bit of that went back to the kitchen too. Really the only reason we ate any of it was we'd been waiting an hour at this point and were starving.Two stars is generous for this disappointment of a restaurant. Being charged 2.40 euro for a teeny little bottle of water was the final straw, when all we wanted was a glass of tap water.  Save your money, avoid this one and go elsewhere. Also, they wouldn't accept my card for payment.More,Good pizza and great value 
Waitress rather hostile told us off for having the menus closed before we were ready to order,We stopped in without knowing the restaurant.and, we were pleasantly surprised... The owners were from Naples. We had pizza, delicious, and seafood with pasta..It had prawns, mussels, calamari and was a goodsized portion....Price reasonable also...Will go back 
again. Friendly service...","The most funny part is that you are served by both humans and real robots, however some humans act as robots as well.",
"Fried items are bad. Very tough texture. Almost all the fried food items were very tough. Service wise was good. Food came in promptly.,Re-visit the restaurant to try the Oysters that weren't available when I came previously

Orders came 1st and staffs are excellent

However, despite, paying $15++ top-up, they purposely took very long to fulfill Oyster orders and we have to chase multiple times for it... Wun...top-up anymoreMore,Quality of Sashimi was great and service staff were responsive, courteous and alert. Price is reasonable,The ordering process is a bit messy and hard to use. The food is normal and i do not think it is worth the money. Be prepare to drink lots of water after the meal.,Foods are damn good, especially the ladyâ__s finger. They have like variety of japanese cuisine, people who like japan. Come here!,Shin Minori has not failed to provide good quality sashimi, sushi and grilled meats for the buffet menu. Thoroughly enjoyed the range of fresh fish in the sashimi and sushi, as well as the fresh unagi and octopus. The mini hotpot range of soups is...limited to only 3 types, but they were very good value for money. The only disappointment was the removal of the grilled organs (heart and liver) from the grilled meat selection. Would have liked to have it back in the buffet menu!More,Every piece & dish was made with
care and consistency. Needless to say it was â__Oishiâ__!! The servings were prompt,I have no idea. Why a Japanese restaurant wants to include cheese in nearly all its handrolls and Maki. The cheese made it so disgusting to eat. Ingredients such as seaweed, fish and oysters are not that fresh. 

The food was still ""edible"" in the...sense that if I was starving, I would still eat it.

The staff however was quite nice, good service.

Really quite disappointing, this was supposed to be my last nice family meal before heading into NS. The food was really quite substandard.

Upon my mother's instance, I am required to mention that the lack of red bean desserts for a Japanese restaurant, is an absolute travesty.More,I really enjoyed my time at Shin Minori - the food variety was great with nice ambience and fast service. I went there once to try it out and brought a friend on another occasion. That friend is also bringing their family this weekend!,The food is nice but environment is not so good. Table too smAll for the buffet. You need to order the food canâ__t take buy yourself.,I enjoyed the meal there with my family.  The food is good and the service provided by Jessie is excellent.  thank you.,There is a good variety of food on the menu for the buffet. Most taste good and some arrive prettily presented. The last order for lunch is stated to be 2.15pm. I thought we would be able to sit around for a while after that...and finish up our food and drinks, however shortly after 2.15pm one of the staff went around informing customers that they were closed and stood at the exit looking at us. We felt compelled to quickly leave which kind of dampened the experience.More,This is a very pleasure meal I had recently. This is the second times I have visited. Double thumb up bit the staff services and food served. 
Thank you.,Overall I am very satisfied with both food and services. 
Just 2 things. 
1. Some sause could be too sweet. I ordered the grill salmon head. Came with the sweet sauce favor. 
2. Web address did not state the restaurant was at level 3. Asked...the security to direct my way.More,Came here after reading some negative reviews, but food and service were really good and exceeded our expectations!! Food were served quickly by staffs as well as the cute robot. 2 minor mix-ups in the order but thats fine, we tried smth nice that we...didnt order HAHAHA overall dining experience was chill and enjoyable :) really worth if u have the 1for1 promotion!!More",None,
"Slow & rude service.  They ignore you when stood ready to order & if they do deign to speak to you, the following service is painfully slow.  Fast food it certainly is not.
No polite, friendly, efficient service here & if you do eventually get...served, the food is poor; burned McMuffin & tepid porridge.
How do you get things this wrong?More,Dreadful. Cold unappetising food. Luke warm chips. No sauce in big mac. Milkshakes off as machine was broken apparently. Staff interaction with customer non existent. Worst mcdonalds I have had visited. AVOID,Went there at 0515 to get breakfast. Went to drive thru and sat there for a few minutes. No one bothered to speak to me so I went into the restaurant and there was only one customer there. So I went to the counter to...order. Only one person behind the counter and she looked up at me and then went back to spraying the hot plates. Totally ignored me. So I left as I am not standing there to be ignored. Nearly every time I have been to this place there has been a problem. Suffice to say it will be the last resort for me to go there again.More,Horrific place, from the ridiculously long wait in the drive thru to the creature that verbally assaulted my ear drums when I was finally served, no please, no thank,  just an utterly rude person, another queue for food of only 6 to 8 cars which...took forever, food was literally thrown at me out the window, burger was cold, fries were over cooked but least the cappuccino was good. Iâ__ll drive past this maccies next time Iâ__m in the area & visit somewhere more efficient & professional with staff that can be polite & string syllables together!More,Went here today, ordered a  chicken legend meal , without lettuce, I reminded the fella that I didnt want lettuce, so he said ' I,l go n tell them , they told me to wait at the 3rd window, which I did , my latte...was cold so they made me a hot one , when I got home I had lettuce in my chicken legend , so what was I waiting for, obviously  they cudnt be bothered to listen, I also asked for ketchup and the girl said oh we,l give u it after with the meal your waiting for, there was no ketchup either , the service is terrible, I certainly  wont be going againMore,It was terrible I received a banana milkshake with chocolate milkshake at the bottom I canâ__t believe my eyes this is unbelievable I hope this doesnâ__t happen to anyone else,sat outside all tables were filthy, had to ask for a cloth to clean ours  and ended up wiping them all down. The cloth was clean but disgusting after I had wiped the tables down. the bin was overflowing with rubbish. there was gunge up...the sides of the windows which needed cleaning and the floor needed a pressure clean. won`t be going back,More,Shocking service today. The restaurant was overflowing. I ordered food at 12.05 pm and it was finally provided at 12.35. The chips were not only cold, but also stale, the drink was half filled with no ice, and the Big Tasty burger was anything but....It spoilt a family trip out. We definitely will not be returning!More,Order placed at 20:05 Order received 20 :40
Has to be the slowest service ever for a quarter cheese meal. Under cooked and cold fries. 
Clearly the restaurant can not  cope.
Stop on line orders and/or close the drive through until you get the front...of house sorted.
The worst McDonald's anywhere by a country mile.More,No words for what we have found today. Both Clifton Moor and Leeming Bar Mc Donald needs some serious looking into.,Service with a smile. Quick and exactly what we ordered. Place was kept nice and tidy.  I made a mistake with my order and the staff were eager to fix it for me without any fuss.,Dirty mcdonalds took 20 minutes to get the order then they ran out of cold drinks even tho we had paid for a large come refused to do anything about it. All the bin where overflowing and sauce all over the tables not been cleaned...all day. Coffee tasted of nothing tooMore,Called at drive through 1030am to buy 2 Milk shakes to cheer My Niece and Nephew up after meal out canceled due to tier 3 enforcement and was my nieces birthday!

Sat for 10 mins in drive through que to get to order and was...informed these items not available as serving breakfast at this time! Why not the machine would have been on and told breakfast menu till 11am! Then had  to sit for another 5 mins to get out of drive through que! Never go here again or the one at Poppleton which is very unefficient! 

Arrived Monks Cross one at 1050 which was serving breakfast and came away Happy with 2 milk shakes before 11amMore,Took little one for a birthday treat, very friendly staff and even gave little one free icecream and sang happy birthday which made it special, Same as all the chains reasonably priced and brilliant table service.,I have found over the last few months this McDonalds has gone down hill!! Food is often stale and not very hot. Today though the service was terrible. Sat at the drive threw screen whilst 3 cars drove up and used the other. I reversed...went to that screen and said I think the other screen isnâ__t working as Iâ__ve been sat there whilst 3 cars have been served to which I just received a smarmy comment.More"," The food was delivered to us by a robot, which seemed bizarre, because the atmosphere of the restaurant, at first glance, seemed classy. That might have been because there were only a few of them and they were counting on the robot to take care of some of their duties. I do not think",
"Had a long layover and was starving so decided to drop in for a long meal. The food was delicious and the service was great.,If you are going to put chicken and waffles in the menu, at least make fresh waffles!  Toaster waffles wonâ__t cut it. They were burnt to boot!  I know Iâ__m at the Dallas airport but this should not be allowed by corporate!,But got better.  No sign at front saying â__please wait to be seatedâ__ and nobody there;   So we just walked in and sat down.  Big mistake!  Hostess was kind of ...witchy about it, fussed at us a bit.  Almost told her she has one less...table to worry with.  After that,  the waitress was good, inquiring about flight time for rush or no rush.  Good French onion soup, spinach/artichoke dip, burger and onion rings.  Could recommend;  but management needs a â__wait to be seatedâ__ sign and hostess needs to go to charm school.  Also, they hit diners up for a donation.  Do not think they should do that.  I always start with 4 stars, and I deducted 1 for seating thing, (get a sign)  and deducted a star for the donation hit-up.  But food was good and not too pricey for airport fare.More,After battling Friday morning traffic through north Dallas, we arrived at DFW only to find that our flight was delayed for a few hours.  TGI Fridays was right next to our gate so we decided to grab breakfast.  There were some wonderful choices to enjoy....My wife had the french toast and I ordered the steel cut oatmeal.  Both were delicious.  As an airport restaurant, it's on the pricey side and the service was a bit inattentive.More,I only had 15 minutes but I was able to get a Diet Coke and a Caesar salad and have still time to make it to my flight. Very tasty but what was most amazing was the great service.    There is far more seating than...what appears from the terminal area.More,We were hungry after an early flight and had a bit of a layover. We all enjoyed our meals. I had the Cobb Salad with chicken. It was very good. Service was quick.,Had the French dip it was very good, the fries were not.  Service was okay, fairly quick.  Sat in a booth, nice until they filled the booth next to me every time they moved the whole booth shook.,I was trying to eat healthy so ordered the veggie burger which I believe is called Beyond Meat. It was very tasty. Combined with a side salad, I had safe alternatives while watching my weight in an otherwise calorie heavy restaurant.  Service is outstanding and...I never had an empty glass on my table.More,I travel often and really wanted to give the TGIF @ Terminal A, DFW Airport a big kudos for training their staff so well.  I was greeted by Evelyn and requested a quiet table because I had a conference call in 10 minutes.  She took...me to an area that appeared to be closed and made it happen.  She was SO nice, friendly and understanding.  I can't thank her enough.  I was taken care of by Sierra and asked if it was possible to have lunch instead of breakfast, as it was pretty early.  Again, no problem.  She got me a lunch menu.  I know these are little things, but it just shows consideration.  The food was good, atmosphere was great and service was excellent.  Thank you!!More,Had a great server that took real good care of us!!  Food was good as well!  Always get the sizzling chicken.  Will stop by again!  Forgot to take picð___,Food was very good. Service, on the other hand, not so much. Server appeared disinterested and was not attentive. She carried my drink to the table in her armpit.,Friendly service , thereâ__s was a kids menu and the things the grandkids had they liked. Also they have the most Awesome pretzels on the appetizer menu ! I had the salmon it was perfectly cooked ! Itâ__s not hard to find at all ,...go enjoy !More,I visit many places while traveling and always go through DFW. First time to TGI Fridayâ__s and Iâ__ll return! Server Gail was outstanding and egg tools awesome. I would come back in even just for a drink if Gail would be my server. Kudos to...GailMore,I was welcomed by the hostess who took the time to clean off the table I preferred. She was very friendly and courteous on my arrival and when I left.
My waiter was very friendly, prompt, and offered appetizing suggestions.
I had the Dragon Glazed...Chicken with vegetables and mashed potatoes. The sauce on the chicken was fabulous.
Sad there arenâ__t any Fridayâ__s in my area anymore, but at least I get to eat there when I travel.More,Stopped in for an early lunch in between flights and found this chain restaurant to be quite nice. 
The chicken quesadilla were the perfect order to fill that hunger void and paired with the local IPA beer it was a complete meal.", I didn't have to wait too long for my meal to arrive and that includes the travel time for this absolutely adorable cat robot to deliver my meal from the kitchen to the dining room. There are two of these robots: one is in the dining room and I deduced the other was in the kitchen,
"Stopped to get a drink and had to wait 20 minutes for the two cars in front to be served.  Staff working with all the speed of paint drying.

Crap service.,Food was totally COLD! Cant believe how bad it was, chips werent even warm, went thru drive thru! Total CRAP!,20 minutes for 2x fries and chicken sticks for kids. Actually rediculous. Staff seem too relaxed and no urgency.,It seems im just adding to the list of bad reviews. Waited 40 mins along with many others. Very understaffed and the front counter staffer told the kitchen to shut the f@#$ up!! Very poor service all round, they seemed to have no system to...be working from.. many upset people there today..
I wont be back. Maybe BK need to read their reviews as they all say basically the same of turangi franchise.More,Bro ngl best feeds at the tgi bk we got no maccas but we got bk and they awnn as owa owa the customer service is awnn as too but it was great they are located in turangi lol obviously,Customer service was definitely better than some burger kings Iâ__ve been to in my time. Loved my meal and crispy chips definitely will be stopping in again when next on the road.,Stopped by with my family when heading back to our home after a good needed vacation and was pleased with the service me and my family received. We did have a problem with the kiosks but than was told by a employee that they tend...to cut out due to the wifi which than helped me understand why it wouldnâ__t take our order. My kids loved their nugget king boxes and my husband throughly enjoyed his Hawaiian burger, I also enjoyed my Bk chicken meal and will be stopping in again!More,The customer service here is abysmal and rude. Burger King should step in and do something about this franchise as they are giving Burger King a bad name.
After waiting in the queue of 4 groups for 10 minutes or longer, we eventually got served...by being told to use the kiosk. The kiosk didn't work & when we told them this they just shrugged & turned away. We could not go through the drive through as our trailer was too high. All 4 lots of customers including ourselves walked out. We took our money somewhere else.More,ok but dirty tables and no one cleaning tables , yuk people had to push scraps of food off tables on to floor and no one cleaning floors yuk very low class of takeaway, next time stick to drive though, hopefully food is made better...than the out house!More,Rubbish 0/5 food is rubbish, place is very untidy basically filthy. Staff are young and undertrained. Keep driving to taupo, or Wellington skip turangi.,Stopped here for dinner on the way through to Wellington. Wish we had kept driving.. it took 40 minutes to get our order through the drive through. The staff were rude and need training in customer service. No apologies for the wait, just dumped our...food and closed the window. They said they were under staffed, but if they had given us an advanced warning about the wait time we would have eaten elsewhere. Wont stop here again.More,I was given churros that were liberally dusted with salt instead of cinnamon and sugar. Disgusting and very slow service despite the lack of customers.,Slow, slow, slow service the team serving were rude slamming the window. Ordered a frozen raspberry only to recive a drink that tasted rotten and missing items out of order will not return,rudest staff I 've ever been served by....dumps the food on the table slams the window absoltue ignorance,Traveling to Taupo and stopped for dinner. Walked in at 6:45. Queued for about 15 minutes. One till out of 3 open. The place was a tip. Rubbish everywhere, the toilets were disgusting. Waited and waited. While waiting, one of the girls called out to...the queue that there was only chicken orders left!? Our number was not called out but skipped. Had to go ask where it was. They then made it. No apologies. Onion rings were dry and horrid, chips cold. Walked out at 7:40. Other times we have been here, we have not been impressed with service and restaurant. After this episode, never again!More"," The ""inhabitant"" even acknowledged it was a ""robot"".",
"Every time I go I leave annoyed.  Straws are missing or nugget sauce..... today I had two mobile orders that was placed - one for myself and another my friend placed which I offered to pick up.  When I was at the speaker I told...the lady I had two mobile orders, and after about of minute of telling me she couldnâ__t find the orders, she finally did.  When I arrived at the pick up window the manager Argued (yes argued) with me that the order could not be found.  I asked him why the other girl could find them and he couldnâ__t.  He eventually found it, and of instead of apologizing that he was wrong, he told me to park for pickup as the order wasnâ__t ready. In the meantime he gave me the first order.  I told him I was friggin annoyed because my first order was going to get cold.  I didnâ__t realize that he told me that he was annoyed too- thatâ__s what my son said after.  I pulled forward to wait for my second order, only to realize that my first order was missing straws.  The unprofessionalism of this manager was ridiculous.  I will never go back to thy location.  The manager needs to learn how to talk to the public. It was like he was pushing all of my buttons - ridiculous.    I would recommend going to any other McDonaldâ__s instead of this one.More,Went there for a quick bite on the way home. I placed my order at 6:12 pm. Everything was correct, I paid for my food. They seemed to be busy as I had to wait a few minutes. The manager came to bring me my...food. What I ordered was two cheeseburgers, a med fry and a med Coca Cola. What he tried to give me was two cheeseburgers and a Diet Coke. Iâ__ve never in my life order a Diet Coke. When I tried to inform him of the wrong order, he told me that this is what I order and this is what I was getting. He was willing to fix my drink but not give me fries, even when I offered to pay more for fries. He came back with a receipt and my now fixed drink. The time stamp read 6:07 pm. When I tried to explain that this was not my order or receipt, he shoved the burgers into my window with the receipt and walked off. Iâ__ve never felt compelled to tell anyone that they lost my business but this place definitely did until at least better management. I understand that the food industry can get rough and that they are busy but when a polite customer is trying to speak and for a manager to just walk off? Thatâ__s rude. Seems to get worse every time I come.. whatever happened to customer service?More,The food is mediocre. The staff are excellent. The owners of this McDonald's refuse to heat the men's washroom. It has been broke or turned off for OVER a year. I spoke to the Manager about this issue and it still is not fixed or...turned on. I am guessing the Owners are too cheap to fix the issue or turn on the heat. My recommendation is avoid this place like the plague. There is a A&W just down the road in a Petro Canada that does heat their washroom and the prices are decent.  Nobody should have to freeze when they use a bathroom. The owners of this restaurant obviously do not care.More,Hello, never do reviews.  All 4 computer kiosks were down.  The employees could not be bothered to come and take my order.  15 minutes standing there like and idiot to not get served at all.  6 people waited before me, got frustrated and left.  Horrible...service.  Location dirty with garbage not picked up all over the tables.  Please go elsewhere.  If this is the future of McDonalds, they are inviting competition.  Very sad at the decline of service. I will spend elsewhere.More,The thai chicken chili tasty bites were the tastiest items in town... .hands down!  Kiosk ordering made it easy to customize, and preparation was quick.,Leaving for our yearly trip south early in the morning we stopped here because it is fast and usually the only one open so early. This is a typical McDonald's the food was hot and ready fast. Even at this early hour the place was...busy but we were served right away and the staff was friendly. The restaurant was clean and tidy and the service was good.More,Went to the McDonalds at Magnetic Hill.  Service here is very slow and staff are not very careful putting together the orders. In the time I was there waiting for my order (which was way to long) five people came back with incorrect orders.  When...I received my order I checked the wrapper and it seemed ok.  Upon arriving home and opening the breakfast sandwich I found it not correct.  What I ordered was not what was there.  As the person who was to have the sandwich cannot eat what was there she went without and it got thrown out.  This is not the first time this has happened here.  The only reason I go there is it is close to where I live.More,We stopped in to this McDonald's on our way home after visiting the zoo. The food was as expected from McDonald's, so no issues there.

I used the new ordering kiosk and chose table service. It took about 15-20 minutes for our food to arrive...at our table. It might have arrived sooner, but the person bringing our food out to us couldn't find us at first. I had to wave the table marker around and another customer pointed us out to him. The table markers they were using lay flat on table and are normally used to let customers know their table is ready.

McDonald's this move to the ordering kiosks has not been an improvement. Wait times for food have gotten longer, orders get messed up more often and a lot of the time the systems just don't work.More,A group of us men ( 4-6 ) meet every Friday am for breakfast. There is lots of parking at that establishment which can be very busy, especially during tourist season. The service is reasonable and the food is OK- I usually order eggs/hash brown...which are very good. They serve excellent coffee and you get free refills.The restaurant is usually very clean.More,very good quick place to grab breakfast before getting on the road, this is where we usually stop and we are not disappointed.,MacDonalds use to be a quick place to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Not so much any more the wait time is huge and the place is usually not so clean.  I do enjoy Carol the cashier as she is the most...friendliest person there and the coffee is great.More,What can I say .. it is a McDonald's ... No more and no less.
Very busy one do to its very easy on and easy off from the highway.
Good sized parking lot but in my opinion, the traffic pattern is a little goofy...in it.
People talk about cold fries ... I find that very common at a McDonald's ... Secret to getting piping hot fries is to order them with no salt and add the salt after ..  piping hot and crisp every time.More,This is a BIG busy frantic McD's.  The location next to the TCH and the proximity of hotels, fuel stops and highway junctions creates a hectic atmosphere.  The drive through is as busy as a hornets nest, but if  you choose to eat inside, it...is spacious enough that you'll find large seating, a quiet space to review a paper or something in between, like that soccer ? team that was there the last time I was. 

I still found a quiet nook and enjoyed my off highway interlude.  I like this location because you are at the TCH/126 Junction, which gets me to the less hectic highways of the province I like to travel.

Like any McDonald's service can be somewhat spotty but I always remember what I was like on my first job, so I cut these kids some slack.  I mean, didn't Mark Zuckerberg still there?More,Staff are nice but not the most energetic I have ever met.   As well I used to frequent this place often. But now by pass it and go to the one further down the Rd on mountain Rd or Walmart.    Small changes seemed to have...happened recently, Including having to ask for simple items like salt and pepper.  ( and than u get one of each).  Other than that food is what you would expect from Mcdonalds.More,Stopped for a quick meal.  I wanted a BLT quarter pounder Meal without the Lettuce and Tomato. Reason is that it is less expensive to get the quarter pounder with bacon this way.  The person on cash said she would just do a quarter pounder...and add bacon.   Meal ended up costing more than it should have if she had given me what I ordered.  And the fries were cold.More","Your greatest at the door by a robot hostess that gives you a wait number. When you enter into the shop,...there is a robot. A ticket will be dispense from this robot.",
"For a Jack in the Box restaurant, this location delivered food quickly and the order was correct, and I consider it to be one of the better franchise locations in Nashville.,I rated this experience as poor due to a few factors.  The food was fine but I ordered no lettuce on my tacos and of course there was lettuce.  Food service was slow inside with no one in line.  I saw people in the drive...through drive away after more than 5 minutes with no service.  The drink machine was out of everything except a few Diet Fanta flavors; you would really need to neglect changing the syrups for days or weeks for this to happen.  The restaurant was reasonably clean but lots of water on the floor by the drink machine.  Overall I would probably find another location next time I was in town.More,We're from Chicago and have no Jack In the Box Restaurants anymore. I was THRILLED to see a Jack In The Box and put it on my to do list. 5 of us visited Jack in the Box and just ordered tacos ($18.00).... tacos are...a must!! Are they real Mexican tacos? Of course not. Do they have real meat? I don't think so. Were they good? HELL YEAH, just like I remember them. I got my taco fix and enjoyed every minute of it. The service was ok... young people who are ""just doing their job"". There was this one guy who had a little energy and was fun but the rest were emotionless and robotic, not even sure they had teeth. Thank you Jack in the Box for not changing your tacos!!More,We came for a quick meal since our hotel is right down the road. 2 male ""kids"" working were horse playing & didn't greet us. I'm fine with making work fun but greet your customers...ultimately without customers, you wouldnt exist.  The girl at the register...finally greeted us & she was friendly, but could barely hear her & never once saw her smile. The two boys in the back still horse playing. The lobby is filled with dirty tables, food on the floor and over flowing trash cans. The drink machine has mold on it which could easily be cleaned if someone took 2 seconds to do it. We cleaned our own table and chairs to sit. The restrooms are not working so cant use them. I am not sure why we decided to stay & eat, kinda scary that we decided to, but we did & food was good. My thinking is, if the lobby looks like this, what does the kitchen look like. We watched a line of people wait while no one was at the register & some lady in leggings & Jack in the box shirt came to lobby & yelled ""someone come to the counter"" instead of assisting or greeting customers. This same lady yelled dining rooms need attention, so that's a plus, hopefully the customers after us wont see the filth we did. We just got our food when she said that & 20 mins later, the lobby still looks the same...I understand it might be hard to find quality help but at this point the manager should have been out here cleaning. 

Super neglected restaurant. I've been to several Jack in the Box restaurants & never seen one so nasty.More,Not from the area, but this place is locked up tighter than a prison and not very clean. Staff are rude and ignore you while you stand waiting at the counter. The safety of the area is questionable as well, which is probably why one...entrance and the bathrooms are locked.  The temperature indoors was frigid!  

Wait for the food was way longer than expected. For two people, we waited 20 minutes and there was only one other customer at the time inside that arrived after we did, and 3 cars in drive thru, which all received their food before we did even though they ordered way after. 

As far as the food... it tasted as expected, quite a bit on the greasy side, but as expected for fast food.

I would recommend going to a different place to eat and skip this one.More,Because they were one of the few restaurants  open late, we tried it. The food was terrible, and we would not go back.,A friend & I are in town for Christmas Village & stopped by here on the way back to the hotel our first night. The bacon cheeseburgers were terrific but the French fries were ice cold. It took several minutes for our burgers so we...thought the fries would be hot as well but they were not and the place wasnâ__t busy as we were the only people in line for several minutes, hence the reason for the 3 stars.  Overall, we would eat here again if looking for a fast food restaurant.More,We had lunch here one day on our trip. The food was good and hot. It was the first time at Jack in the box for most of us and all were pleased with their meals.,We stopped by after a concert because it was close to our hotel. Although the staff was friendly to me, they seemed short with some others, telling them they werenâ__t serving certain things for the rest of the night, although they were open 24 hours....I waited in the drive thru for about 15 minutes before placing my order. Had we not been so hungry and too tired to drive anywhere, we would have gone somewhere else.More,We came into town late so wanted to get something fast and fairly cheap.. this jack in the box has the most friendly staff and they seem to actually care about customers. The food was great. I had a number one and my wife had...a number two and both were phenomenal! Great place to stop!!!More,Food was very good and not expensive, better than your typical fast food place, nice and clean inside.,Food was good. While eating, cops and ambulance fire truck went by turns out there was a shooting a half a block from the restaurant but the restaurant was located in a quaint little area kind of in the woodsy.,I do not usually give lousy reviews but Jack in the Box earned it this past Sunday evening. 6:30 pm so it wasnt late but Fries were almost cold and double cheeseburger was so well done that i pitched it after several bites. Staff very...un-interested basically communicating among themselves.  Do not think Jack in the Box is in my future for mealsMore,Greasy and cheap and a great guilty pleasure. Service left something to be desired---they were very lackadaisical.,The only saving grace is the food! If not, this would be a 1! The burgers were great and so was the shakes. Never got to taste the late night menu items, because they decided to close early in a Saturday night and shut off...the grill! First visit during lunch was horrible! Nobody there, but the service was incredibly slow! The staff didnâ__t look like they want to be there and that itâ__s beneath them to take our orders! They were more interested in talking with each other, than getting the orders. We didnâ__t want to go back at night, but it was the closest quick bite close to our hotel. Couldnâ__t get food because as I said earlier, they closed up without giving an explanation. Waited drive thu for about 16 minutes, until it was our turn. As soon as we got to the order window, we heard sorry we are closed!More",This like robot... No... I think a robot would say hello/thank you/goodbye at least... A robot could be more human...,
"I have one problem with this restaurant It opens at 5:00 a.m. not 4:00 a.m.  fix that  Online and I'll be happy,Just a standard McD, clean and friendly staff. Probably the best tasting hashbrown. Most McD's have old grease taste, like the oil has been returned too many times.,Unable to go through drive-through, and unable to download the app (no smart phone for these seniors!), I called to make an order.  Though the phone was answered, I could not make the order for me and my husband:  ""No phone orders!  Order on-line only....Goodbye.""  Being one of a large demographic of seniors traveling in RVs, I was offended and felt unfairly treated.  I think a person could be hired specially to take phone orders,  put them on the app, and communicate.  Be nice.  And deliver curbside.  We won't be back, even if the dining room is open and COVID is gone.More,Coming up from the valley it is the midway stop whenever we pass through.  This trip the lobby and dinning room were closed due to COVID ... drive through only.,After traveling 2,000 miles over 5 days, was shocked to see that this establishment (and many others in the area) will sell you food but not allow you into the building to use the restroom to wash your hands before eating.  I understand we are...under Covid precautions and this is Arizona but if the truck stops can do it (they clean their bathrooms EVERY HOUR) then why can't McDonald's.  Extremely disappointing!More,Stopped in for ice cream, flurries and sundais. We were surprised by the size if this McDonalds. Lots of room with fast service.,I rate restaurants for what they are trying to be.  This particular location is at the top of its game  in the fast-food market.  The entire restaurant reflects good management: friendly, responsive staff who are hustling to attend to every aspect of the operation --...from cleaning to interacting with customers.  And the staff -- mature adults -- appear to interact positively not only with customers but also with each other.  I've not been in a better McDonald's.More,If it isn't meal time, we usually stop here for a bathroom stop and my husband gets a coffee and I get a pineapple/mango smoothy.,The usual McDonald's fare but the restaurant was clean and the service was fast and friendly. The restrooms were clean and well stocked.,Fast service at a newly remodeled McDonalds in Payson.  Pricing seemed unusually high, but other than that it was pretty typical.,The service was good and the food was exactly what you would expect from McDonalds.  It cost around $25 for three of us to have breakfast though which seemed a bit steep for breakfast on the go.   The bacon, egg and cheese McGriddle was very...good.More,My Sausage, Egg, Biscuit, was very good.  Even the biscuit was tasty.  Service was timely & the lobby was well taken care of.
  Good to see the owner/operator of this restaurant, took control of the design people & didn't listen to them.  Restaurant lobby is...larger than most & you have space to walk without bumping into tables & people.  Even has an Antler Chandelier. Nice job on a re-image project.More,Place was filthy and not a great place. Service took 40 minutes for a fast food place. No one took care of the dining room trash all over in the restraunt.,I normally go through the drive thru but it was backed up so I went in. The first time I had been in the store since they redone the front end. I didn't know what to do, everything was different. I went to the one...cash register they had and asked the guy running around back there if I could order from here (that's what I had always done before).  He told me I would have to wait behind all the others using the app on their phones or the big screens in the lobby. So I walked up and began to read the big menu screen, the guy beside me was having problems too. I followed the instructions and got the hang of it, because I use my phone to buy things all the time. Had to wait a bit longer then I thought I should have and wished I had gone through the drive thru after all. I will use the app and see if it is faster. The reason I gave 5 STARS was because of the fries, hot and salty... Something you can always count on.

P.S. They are one of the few places that still have a real $1 menu... WesleyMore,This was a ""pit stop"" for us on the way to Flagstaff; we stopped for a stretch and an ice cream cone.  The new interior was a pleasant surprise -- very well laid out (unlike a lot of McDonald's), room to move around and a...big variety of seating.  The kids' play area is gone, and the new design (antler chandelier!) is more comfortable and reflects the area.More", We ordered food for 2 people using the robot Starship service.,
"Itâ__s a cafe with nothing outstanding at first glimpse. The coffee is mind blowing. Havenâ__t tried their food but the cakes and savories are very nice.,While visiting Singapore we discovered this cafe with delicious crumbed fried chicken wings and mouth watering truffle oiled potato chips accompanied by hot coffee. We repeated this lunch the next day before we flew home. This little meal has lingered longer in our memory than...we would have expected from this amazing city.More,Review/rating is based on service and ambience alone as I did not eventually make a purchase. I read the reviews before coming here on 30 June, 10.30am. Based on that, I wasn't expecting great service but I certainly did not imagine this. At the counter...we asked the waitress (A) how the eggs were prepared in the Signature Breakfast. She said ""Did you see the picture at the front? That's how it is."" That's a non-response. So we asked again, â__No, we did not see it. Is it poached?â__ Flummoxed, she went into the kitchen and convened with her colleague. She returned and said â__No, it is not poached.â__ There are more than 2 ways to make eggs, I certainly donâ__t know what she thinks I should understand from her response. Itâ__s like squeezing blood from a stone. We replied, â__Well how is it done then??â__ Silence. Then she turns and goes back into the kitchen to meet colleague. She returns and says â__The eggs go in the oven.â__ In other words â__ baked eggs. We were so irritated by this exchange that we decided to drop the Signature Breakfast order and just get a sandwich. I told the waitress, â__Can I order the Jambon sandwich?â__ Then, another waitress (B) came out and dumped loaves of bread on the counter in front of us, presumably for a takeaway order. Waitress A busied helping her arrange the loaves. I repeated my order, and waitress A impatiently said â__Wait.â__ That was it, we did not need this type of treatment, especially when there are so many other options a few steps away. We left and had a splendid breakfast (and service) from the local Malay coffeeshop opposite the mall. It is unfortunate that we experienced this as the caf_© is nicely decorated and the food looked tempting. But the wait staff are in desperate need of additional training on what the service industry is about.More,We have found this area by chance, but it deserved to be visited. This cafe in European style offers big variety of bread and pastries, excellent coffee, fresh juice. Good service.,They gave me a table number after odering and i went to seat at a far end table as there was no other seats. I waited for 40 mins for my food and was still not here so i went to the counter. They say...that they said the order already but i sat at the far end and could not heard it. They did not bother to come find the customer although they me a table number. They just left my food there to become cold. Such a lazy service!!!More,Visited twice during our stay at Village Hotel.

Lots of sandwiches, pastries etc.

It gets busy with local people and tourists.

Ask for a menu, as this is a place where you order at the counter and it can be confusing without one.

Sandwiches are...big enough for two.More,What a pleasant surprise! Definitly worth a visit... weâ__ve ordered the pancakes and the croissant. Both dishes were fantastic ð___,We have stayed at the Village Hotel three times now and I am always up early for my favorite morning treats, a pan au chocolate and a cappuccino. 
The pastries are delicate and flaky. The perfect pairing for my sleepy self.More,Hey there blumphotography!

Great to hear how much you've enjoyed our croissants thank you so much! Do try out our dinner menu, the food is just as good! Happy to hear from you and we look forward to seeing you very soon! Thank you.

Best...More,I was quite pleased with my signature breakfast this morning. It was tasty and well prepared. The cappuccino was hot and equally flavorful. 

I found it a bit difficult to find the restaurants location based on the google map and website. It is located inside...the Katong V building on the second floor in the center of the mall. 

I find restaurant prices in Singapore to be a bit high and this restaurant is on par with others. One coffee and signature breakfast was $20 SGD but well worth it.More,Hey PeeGadget!

Thank you for your review! We are glad that you enjoyed the food! Do come back for more and do try out our dinner menu, equally yummy! Do also keep a look out for any upcoming promotions on our Instagram and Facebook page!...More,The breakfast mains were very good. The pain au chocolat was amazeballs, everyone freaked out on them. Ambiance of the place is open air inside of a small mall, would be more interested to check out their location in town - I think its Keong...saik road.

Will definitely check out their lunch and dinner fares.More,Hello Crabjunkie!

We are so glad to hear that you enjoyed our food! Great choice on the pain au chocolate there! Do visit our Keong Saik outlet, we serve dinner here and the food is just as good! Thank you so much once again and...More,Found this amazing cafe at level 2 of Village V or Village Hotel at Katong. You need to take the escalators and you will find this open cafe and surprisingly conductive to do your work and most importantly, the wifi is strong important for business...user like myself.

Order a cafe mocha and it is actually pretty good and the service is pretty high standard as well.

Will come back to this cafe again for sure. For business travellers staying at Katong it is certainly a nice place to catch up on your emails.More,Thank you kennyt615 for your honest and kind review! We are glad you are able to work peacefully here at out Katong V with no problems. Your reviews means a lot to us. We strive to serve great quality food and genuine service. We hope...More,Dropped by twice, in the recent  past: once to eat in, and once to takeaway. I have always enjoyed the fare from B&H from their city centre branch, and this location offers a (potentially) quieter and more relaxed environment. The dine-in experience was a little...bit less than stellar: service crew were a little unsmiling; the saucisse arrived warm on the outside but still chilled on the inside: but, I still enjoyed it! Certainly at 3 pm on a weekday, it was a quiet and relaxed dining experience. The takeaway encounter was less complex, service was prompt (efficient, if not necessarily friendly), and our quiches which we heated up at home (yes, this time the centres were warmed!), were good.
I know the service environment is tough, but a little cheer would add sparkle to the delectable fare on offer. Tantalizingly close to perfection!More,Hi Mostlyharmless,

Thank you for your honest and detailed review. We are glad you enjoyed the food and environment at both of our outlets. Thank you for highlighting about our service crew, we will indeed look into it. We want to make sure our customers...More,The bread here is outstanding. Fresh and delicious. We tried their scones too, marvelous. This place with its coffee and orange juice, is simply served good and perfect breakfast.,Thank you Suria_Nataadmadja , we are glad you enjoyed our food and drinks here at Bread & Hearth. We aim to always provide wide range of fresh pastries and drinks. We hope to have you here again! Have a wonderful day ahead.,Nice little spot nearby the hotel I was staying. Good for pastries and baked goods. Came here regularly for quick and easy snacks and meals.,Thank you Granules2013 for your kind review! I hope you had a wonderful stay and hope to see you again soon!,Good value for money -- tasty, not too sweet and filling. Dined in the first time and the waiting time was at least 15 minutes. Rather frustrating wait although the cafe wasn't crowded on a Sunday morning. Takeaway the second time and waiting time was...bearable at 5 minutes.More,Your reviews are important to us, we thank you for taking your time to leave us a feedback as we aim to improve in our service. We are pleased that you enjoyed our cinnamon bun, and we will work better to improve waiting time. Thank...More","The receptionist didn't say a word she was like a robot, like a cute robot. The bar tender started to make noise with its drink mixer, like a robot.",
"just popped in for a quick cuppa but it appears they do nice snacks ie sausage sandwiches seating arrangements could be improved bit limited.,If you like a walk through a country park then itâ__s for you you can purchase food for the ducks while enjoying a nice cup of coffee plus it has a small play ground area for children .,Had the best steak burger with melted cheese. The guy serving me was pleasant and the service is good. Lovely place for a day trip,What a lovely little cafe. The food is just right for pre or post ramble round the park. Massive baguettes filled with loveliness, washed down with a lovely cuppa. Just be aware that you need cash for the cafe, though Don was the loveliest chap...ever and let me paypal him. Superb service, really friendly staff, and the music in the background was fab and we were bopping along merrily. Even Dolly Dog was allowed in there, which makes life a lot easier. Made a beautiful day all the more sunny. Thank you. :) NicMore,Thank you so much Nic, it's an absolute pleasure to serve people like you, happy smiling, not expecting Michelin star for under a fiver lol x please call again we loved having you.  All the best x Don.,Hey - it is a cafe in a park - what do you expect?  Well the Bacon roll was ok ish - as was the coffee.  However, even for a cafe, I thought the choice was very limited.
The main reason for the poor review...is that the gentleman, who I assume is the owner, has been unjustly rude or boarder line rude on both occasions I visited.  The first time, some months ago was when my friend ordered a coffee but only had a _£10 note.  The owner actually rolled his eyes, grunted and mumbled something about change and car park.  To be honest, if it was me, I could not have stayed quiet, but my friend said nothing.  
More recently I went there with my 84 year old Mother - very sweet little old lady who everyone loves and chats to - he even managed to have attitude again...... I will never return.More,Well, I'm not sure how best to reply to this to be honest , at least you are civil I suppose. Look I think you have answered your own query really.  We offer everyday food but of good quality, cooked properly, at the point of...More,Have visited the park on 3 occasions during this summer holiday and found the cafe closed on our last 2 visits. This time the cafe was open but not able to prepare food as only 1 staff member so drinks and snacks were available but...no sandwiches etc. Disappointing, as our group of adults and children was quite large and were all intending to buy food had it been available but had to settle for drinks and crisps in the end.More,thank you for visiting, we are open 7 days a week, however we do close on rainy days. There hasn't been many of those lately so I am guessing you came out of our trading hours which are 10am until 4pm. This reduces from 1st...More,unfortuntley though I have visited this place many times over the years, was disappointed that last three times iv been up to park there it was not open. previous owners were open most of year round, even if just for a few hrs in morning....but seemly not now.More,Hi Mandy, In a nutshell, that is why the previous owners are no longer in business.

We open from 11am to 3pm (MON to FRI) and stay till 4pm when the schools are out. and from 10am to 4pm (WEEKENDS).

We do not open in...More,We popped in here for a walk around the lake. We had never been here before and were pleasantly surprised. Very clean and well maintained park. Although not a long walk around the lake it is just the right length. We are already thinking about...having a family picnic in the summer this year.

The food hut does have a basic menu but the food is very good, hot and cooked with a smile. There are also toilets and plenty of tables. You do have to pay for parking.More,another lovely review, thank you so much, we are really pleased you had a great day, see you again soon we hope .
Don.,Not only does this cafe stock a massive amount of goodies and quite an extensive menu for a cafe, you can also pay for the car park there which is very helpful. The chap running it was very busy on his own but I still...didn't have to wait long for my order. He was decent enough to make my order again when he put the wrong sauce on it - I don't like brown otherwise I would have just had it anyway! He was probably distracted by half a dozen very noisy children who were getting excited about their ice creams and didn't appear to have any adults with them. They were so loud he had to ask them to quiet down as he couldn't hear his customer! He handled it really well and much to the relief of everyone around got them to shut up! Food was good quality and the hot chocolate stayed warm during our entire walk. I'd go back to the park just for the cafe!More,What a fantastic review, thank you so much. I am usually very careful not to react in these situations, but sometimes you just have to say your piece don't you. I recall it had the desired effect, serving at busy times can be a stressy...More,Went for a walk in the nearby park, and came across this little cafe on the green.  The prices are good, staff are very helpful, and friendly - even on a very chilly Sunday in February.  Hot chocolate were actually hot - which some places...struggle with -  Ideal for a coffee stop before or after a walk round the park, or a play with the kids/grandkids.More,Hello Sarah H, thank you for a great review, our Hot Chocolate is very popular, its real good quality Belgian cocoa, and tastes divine. Especially with the dairy cream topping.
Hope to see you again soon.
Don.,Stopped here unintentionally and boy was I in luck. I had a coffee and a fried egg sandwich. It was delicious, really really tasty and I was so happy. Such a pleasant place, I lokk forward to returning.,Wow, thanks for dropping in and then leaving a great review Phil. Please do call again when your passing. I glad you enjoyed your egg sandwich, we use FREE RANGE eggs, and Fresh bread from the bakery. Thank you.
Don.,Wow, clean , friendly staff and amazing food. I had a bacon sandwich, the best I've had in a long time, fresh bread, generous bacon what more could you want. Will be back again and again.,Thank you Eileen, really pleased you found our Caf_© to be clean , we work hard to achieve such a clean place in the middle of a park. Glad also you love our Fresh Bread, and our Best Quality Bacon. Please call again.
Don.,it was a quiet day so it might not be expected every time but even dogs got free biscuits and a bowl of fresh water. the food was made at the moment, and it took less than 10 minutes for a group of 6.More,hi, thank you for a great review, we love dogs and great customers like you, and it gives us pleasure to provide a service that is appreciated. Sometimes when we get busy we don't always get time to make a fuss of our furry friends,...More,Stopped after a Winters walk with some friends and our respective greyhound dogs and wanted a simple cup of coffee along with a sarnie or two but was taken aback by both the friendliness of the owner and the quality of the food. Bacon in...a stick is excellent, and the dogs were treated to some biscuits, a sausage and some fresh water. Highly recommend for pit stops!More,Thank you so much for a great review, we love dogs, and we love making a fuss of them, fresh water is always available for them, and a treat too if we have time to come outside, you are very welcome, its nice to be...More,Been here many times over the years since it opened, it did change hands, at one time, and though the service and staff are as friendly know as they was, my only bad point is they don't serve the orginal nice soup they use too,...with a chunk of bread, they only have the cuppa soups on offer.so il stick to hot chocolate. But everything else is great, and if your taking the kids to the park, its ideal to have proper toilets and somewhere to get a snack and hot drinkMore,Hi, thank you for such a great review, we may well get ourselves a soup kettle for next winter, thank you for the idea, we are always trying to improve so this helps.
Glad you enjoyed everything else, please call again soon. We need support...More","The service is amazing, there is a super cute robot. Loved the robotic cat waiter, too!",
"Avoid this restaurant.  All of the staff, when you can find them, are incredibly rude.  You have to place your order via their app and it took almost an hour to get our food.  And that was only after multiple visits to try and hunt...down staff to locate the food.  We had to hustle with our uneaten food to our gate as it was boarding.More,The entire system is terrible. You must order online. You canâ__t ask any questions. The â__bartendersâ__ are rude and just stand around talking and playing on their phones. 

Forget about getting a drink made that isnâ__t on the menu; they wonâ__t give you the time...of day . 

There are other places to have a drink; choose somewhere else.More,You know you are going to get stiffed on cost, so it would at least be nice to have your food before your flight leaves.  Not so apparently.,One star, only because the food was OK, and because Trip Advisor won't let me leave half a star or lower. 

That being said... based on my experience with this eatery, I can only conclude that they are incredibly racist and sexist. I was at...Newark Airport Terminal C twice within a week (11/3/21 and 11/8/21), and both times decided to grab dinner at CAPS Beer Garden. Both times, I ordered their beer (24oz) and wings special, because it's inexpensive for the product that you get. Sue me for wanting to save a few bucks, especially with how overpriced airport food is. Also I should note that we both ordered on iPads, and were out of the line of sight of the bar from where we were sitting. 

Both times, I flew with my partner (who is a white male, and his name suggests that he belongs to those demographics), but placed my order before he did. I am a woman of color, and my name suggests as much (obviously feminine name and clearly non-American/â__foreignâ__ last name). Both times, my beer came out, and they gave me a 16oz beer, rather than the 24oz advertised. When I called this out, they handed me an 8oz cup of beer to make up for the discrepancy in the size of the drink. 

However, my partner got his full 24oz on the first try, both times. Also, his order came out much more quickly than mine did, again both times. Why does a person with a name that presents as white and male get the entire product that he paid for (and with quicker service), but I, as a person whose name suggests that they were a woman of color, get shortchanged until I call them out? And they didn't even try to argue, presumably because they knew they were in the wrong. 

So. Women and people with ""ethnic names,"" do not waste your time and money at this location. They will try to shortchange you - you better believe you'll be paying the same price as white men, while getting less product with worse service. Unless you call them out. Disgusting that people still operate this way in 2021, and think they're slick enough to get away with it if no one questions them. 

I know that these days many people like to dismiss anything having to do with the differential treatment that women and minorities receive as ""wokeness"" or ""overly PC"" or what have you, but I genuinely don't know what else to call this behavior but racist and sexist. What I do know, is that I will not be spending my hard earned money at this establishment again, and I urge everyone else (especially women and people of color) to do the same.

Also I should note that we both ordered on iPads, and were out of the line of sight of the bar from where we were sitting. 

Both times, I flew with my partner (who is a white male, and his name suggests that he belongs to those demographics), but placed my order before he did. I am a woman of color, and my name suggests as much (obviously feminine name and clearly non-American/â__foreignâ__ last name). Both times, my beer came out, and they gave me a 16oz beer, rather than the 24oz advertised. When I called this out, they handed me an 8oz cup of beer to make up for the discrepancy in the size of the drink. 

However, my partner got his full 24oz on the first try, both times. Also, his order came out much more quickly than mine did, again both times. Why does a person with a name that presents as white and male get the entire product that he paid for (and with quicker service), but I, as a person whose name suggests that they were a woman of color, get shortchanged until I call them out? And they didn't even try to argue, presumably because they knew they were in the wrong. 

So. Women and people with ""ethnic names,"" do not waste your time and money at this location. They will try to shortchange you - you better believe you'll be paying the same price as white men, while getting less product with worse service. Unless you call them out. Disgusting that people still operate this way in 2021, and think they're slick enough to get away with it if no one questions them. 

I know that these days many people like to dismiss anything having to do with the differential treatment that women and minorities receive as ""wokeness"" or ""overly PC"" or what have you, but I genuinely don't know what else to call this behavior but racist and sexist. What I do know, is that I will not be spending my hard earned money at this establishment again, and I urge everyone else (especially women and people of color) to do the same. 

Photos: 1) the cup that they handed my partner (was full when they handed it to him); 2) comparison between the first cup they handed me and the cup they handed my partner (both were full when they handed them to us); 3) screenshot of the special as it appears on their menu; 4) both cups that they gave me, the emptier one being the one they gave me to make up for the amount of beer they originally shortchanged me (both were full when they handed them to me)More,Typical airport bar located in terminal C. Beer is good and expensive. Service was fast. Ordering tool miss leading (friendly for permanent clients or people having UA airlines credit card,I have never ordered drinks from a pub through an iPad so I needed assistance - when it eventually arrived my card wouldnâ__t swipe so the bartender did it. Then you had to put in your email for a receipt which I havenâ__t received yet!...The actual pint of coors beer was nice but what a palaver we had to go through just before boarding the plane. The 2 drinks we had were expensive too!More,Only ""red' wine in the menu was ""Prisecco"".REALLY!!!!!!!!!!
Saute vegies & stir fry are 2 different things
POOR!!!!!!,1. Really expensive - $11 for a Guinness
2. No â__serviceâ__ - you order and pay in an iPad. Then have to chase someone up for your order. If you have questions, try find someone to answer.
3. Automatically adds 18% gratuity - for what...exactly? You can change it, it you actually realize that they are doing this. I would give 18% to a higher end restaurant who attends me with multiple servers. This is pure greed.
4. You have to pay your gratuity BEFORE you get served - what??? A service charge is dependent on the service you receive - pre-paying is just silly. This place does its employees a disservice (who, BTW hate this system, and it shows).
5. Confusing menu that even the manager canâ__t understand. Receipt shows 1 16oz Guinness and 1 pitcher for $35. Apparently we only get a pitcher. If you upgrade your drink to a 25oz and pitcher, you still get just the pitcher - the exact same pitcher, but you pay $40 for it instead of $35 - erm??? 

These places are lucky they have a captive audience. If this was outside of an airport, it would fail miserably - nobody would put up with this.

If this is the system that is going to be employed in all United Airline terminals, I will not be flying them much longer.More,I like to come here because of two things: their 2 pint beer (Lagunitas IPA) and sushi special at $23 and their huge Chicken Bahn Mi at $14. If you use your United card you get a discount. I recommend this restaurant, in front of...gats C122. Enjoy!More,Sat at the bar with pleasant service. The drinks were a 1 terrible, but the food was a 4 very good. They finally brought us new drinks which were much better. Freshly made food by the Sushi Chef, who apparently knows his way around the...kitchen. Would return for the salmon poki bowl.More,En route on a long journey we were glad to have the opportunity for a drink and a sandwich.  It is convenient in that you sit at your seat and order on the IPad - but it is ridiculously expensive.  Two drinks and one sandwich...in total cost us over _£30....!  Never again...More,The picture show Coord light beer 16 oz  happy hour special. The server came with a bottle Coors light. Not cool. Misleading ads.,They have an assortment of foods, drinks and appetizers that will fit into anyone's taste. Plenty of wine and beer choices too. You can't go wrong whatever you order.,Caps Beer Garden was a quick and easy way to have a nice hot meal delivered at Newark Airport. I ordered via iPad conveniently connected to the dining seat. Staff was friendly and helped customers who were having a hard time understanding the process of...ordering. Food was fresh and fast, perfect for a traveler on the go. I recommend and would eat here again in the future.More,The place is very cute and modern so we decided to give it a try. When you are in an airport you expect high prices, but when pay high prices, I expect high quality. Well, it didnt happen this time with coffee... we ordered and...were very dissapointed...More",You can order your food directly on the app and sometimes a robot waiter brings your dishes to you!,
"Love it very good food, the snow fish , sushi very delicious. Will go back again.
The service also very good.,The best restaurant in Market Village.  I don't say this is the best Japanese restaurant I have visited in my life. I say the best in Marlet Village. You can choose between McDonald's, BurgerKing, Sizzler, or Thai street food. In this case, I recommend Fuji...very much.More,The restaurant is bright and sterile. The food is of very high quality and served fast once you have placed your order. The staff is actively uninterested in looking after the customers when it comes to ordering or taking away finished dishes or paying.,Nothing spectacular, but decent prices. The service can be slow and sometimes the sushi bits are very cold and almost still frozen.,20% off the bills on Tuesday is an amazing deal. Food was fresh and service was average. Note that green tea is not refillable.,We went to have our lunch one day at Fuji restaurant. The staff was alright, but the food was not as good as I had in Bangkok. It seemed to be in Thailand, green tea is something that we have to pay not like in...Japan. We enjoyed the tempura. We will eat Japanese sushi and sashimi only when we go to Tokyo. It was a day when we wanted to have some change for our lunch. It was alright, we ordered what we knew it would be alright.More,After several visits in this chain restaurant in Bangkok, this outlet here in Hua Hin is totally out. Food is below average. Service I can say no service at all. Tea is not refillable which is quite rare for a Japanese restaurant.,I always order only nigiri salmon here or onigiri (rice sandwich) and it is always good quality. I am not sure that i will order something else here, overpriced i think.,After many satisfying visits to this and other Fuji restaurants) in Thailand we were for the third time rather disappointed. The food quality has changed and the service is indifferent, to say the least. 
We will go back to Fuji as we like the concept...and menu but probably not to the one at Market Village. Three disappointing visits are enough.More,We ordered varieties of sushi and the seafood was just ok, but the rice was terribly over cooked and unseasoned. All and all very sloppy. We managed to eat, but would not go there again. Wasabi was nice and service very professional.,Good value well presented food. Quick service by efficient staff. Not sure what else to say. Not the best Japanese food but good value. I would go again.,I have eaten here several times over the past few years and find the food consistently good and fresh and the service quick and efficient.  The sushi and sashimi are delicious.  Yes, it is an expensive option when eating out in Thailand but a good...stop for a fresh snack while in the shopping centre.More,Me and my Thai wife had the pleasure to visit the Fuji testaurant, both in Market Village (second flor) as well at Blueport shopping mall (entrance floor) several times. Everytime the food and service was excellent.

The restaurants are clean and have a large menue...with Japanese dishes spanning from Sushi to hot dishes such as Yakiniku.

I can recommend the plates which comes with a hot dish and an assortment of sushi treats. Always served with a tasty Misu soup and ginger. A disdh like this cost aprox. 480 Baht.

They also have a variety of different starters from 100 Baht and up.

Fuji is well wolrth a visit.More,We went shopping in Market Village and were attracted to Fuji which looked popular with diners at that lunch time.
However, to our disappointment, I found that the batter of the tempura I ordered was not crispy, and the prawn inside did not taste at...all fresh.  My husband ordered a grilled steak in cubes meal, the meat was chewy.
The service in the restaurant was so so.
We should remember not to go back again.More,This place was crowded with a lineup and we mistakenly took this as a sign it would be a worthwhile wait.
Wrong.
The food was ordinary (what good Japanese restaurant serves compacted gluggy sushi rice??).
The sushi was inedible.
The wait for food was too...long.
The only good things were the miso soup and the frozen watermelon drink.
They even charge for ordering wasabi, which is pathetic.
The service was also very slow and the prices are way too expensive considering the lack of quality.
Never again.More", Depending where you sit you might have a robot waiter  ????????.,
"Out for the night round the Craft brewery bars and this was definitely the worst!
Poor service, half the beers werenâ__t available and the place smelt of drains!,Came here to have few drinks and biting with wife and Friends... food is u deservingly expensive. The basics like overpriced french fries are oily and canâ__t
 even eat few out of the plate. Never ever.,Am a beer lover and decided to try Bandra outlet of Brewbot on Sunday 
I love bitter taste and wanted to try Ale or IPA but both were not available
Had to settle with a couple of beers they had but didn't enjoy the taste...Food quantity per plate was very small. Had ordered hummus and pita bread. 

Suggest the company to better increase price but give normal quantity of food per plate when ordered. 
Also brewing own beers, how can they be out of stock of 3 variants out of 6/7More,Feb 9 dinner: In the lane where once Doolally used to be present, we now have another one - Brewbot. The interiors are done in white majorly with wooden furniture - but also has a spaceship kind of feel. The place is quite spacious. 

Botwork...orange - a refreshing beer with a zesty orange flavour. Liked it. 
Regular nachos - crispy nachos served with sour cream and guacamole - yummy
Crispy avocado tacos - soft tacos but the filling consisting of avocado was really yummy
Sriracha cottage cheese pizza - not as hot as the name suggests; crisp base and good taste
Sauteed edamame in soy chilli - the sauce makes it better. a must have

Service was really warm and very attentive

Good food, cool beers and attentive serviceMore,This is my regular watering hole- specially on weekend days, where unlimited Beers of exotic flavours such as Black Mamba, Skywalker, Indian Pale Ale, Pale Ale and other Root and Stout beer, which are homely brewed are available. The snax such as Chicken Piri Piri,...Disco finger chips gets along well with the Beer. In a deal of Rs. 900/- pp, unlimited beer upto 1600 hrs are available in daytime. American, Belgian, German style Stout beer and Ales are available.
Evenings are too congested and too noisy... almost like a disc with super-hep crowd.More", And his little boy will make a great robot when he us older lol,
"not possible to find someone to give information. Millennials will have no problem here, there is always an app to sort you out,the restaurant offered very nice salmon dish along with good wine. The pork / chicken options were also very good.,visited this place for a dinner with family and kids. had a wonderful experience. the staff was very nic and the food quality was amazing.,Small local station. Accepted UK credit cards. Clean and efficient with small cafe on the platform. Approx 12 euro return to Amsterdam.,Small local train station that has no ticket office. Only has a ticket machine that only accepts coins. No notes or overseas credit cards. Bring a lot of coins!,There is no place to purchase tickets from person here,  There are machines that take exact change only. The also take credit cards but DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN CREDIT CARDS.  There is a variety store here but they refuse to give you change. If you...are lucky, a good Samaritan will have pity on you and make change for you but most people only have their European Credit cards and can not help. Best thing to do is walk back to your hotel and get changeMore,Its a nice place just good for walks and not far from Amsterdam city and sea side
I have been there in car so its easy to travel from places to visit,Just a warning for travellers make sure you get to station with a good 15 minutes to spare tickets are purchased via machine  (no staff at station) so can get busy , automated ticket machines are a little long winded !,The station is at the edge of the town and was a distance from the hotel so I was disappointed to find that there was no ticket office only machines. The machines only took coins, no notes nor credit cards, nor debit cards unless they...are maestro. it is better to get the shuttle to the airport and then the trains from there.More,Great place to shop if you have time before your train. They also have a large Dutch wooden shop in front of the flower shop that you can get in and take your picture. Easy to read train schedules are posted through out. All sorts...of food and drinks.More,Nice easy to use train station! Easy access, lots of benches, shelters, there are also a couple of places to get snacks, water, juice, or sodas.","More,Cosy Little restaurant across the road from Robot restaurant.",
"I work across the street and it's almost to convenient for myself and my coworkers.  The app is always having promotions and free items.  It's so easy to flash the app and get a free frappe.  I go over all the time for a quick...lunch.  I've been able to navigate the menu so that my diet is not ruined by a Big Mac every time!More,Stopped here last night for a quick bite. Went in, ordered and was helped quickly. The food (chix nuggets for the youngest and a chix sand. For me) seemed old. I like salt, so I could deal with it - but the fries were very...salty, which concerned me (about others), the place seemed clean....until I went into the bathroom, there was a dead roach on the floor. Never again.More,we always take part in the Wednesday 2 for 1 salads- awesome deal!!  check it out- grilled or crispy chicken bacon salads are fresh and nice size for lunch,My grandson and I went here for dinner. The service was fast and the staff was friendly. The place was clean. They have good food and a nice and clean playground for the kids.,Came in right at switch from breakfast to lunch. They were not prepared - no fries ready and still served some people breakfast. We had to order lunch and waited almost 15 minutes. Food was hot and fresh though! Worth the wait.,Food is the usual but the service at this mcdonalds is so consistently bad, I had to speak up.  There is a significant lack of training eviden as the counter employees never smile and never greet customers.  No good morning, no may I take your...order, no nothing.  This is easily fixed. But its been this way for years.  Wake up management!More","They also have robot as entertainer , my kids danced and played with the robot while we sat and enjoyed our foods .",
"Moved our parents into assisted living.  Now doing the challenge of moving this out of their home.   Starving no lunch or dinner.  McDonaldâ__s always a sure thing.  Always the same menu and usually spot on.  NOT THIS TIME.  
Got three meals at 10:30pm after a...long day in the hospital with a Dad.    One was kinda right but bun burnt.    
Thinking it was late at night give them the benefit of doubt.   
Following week got 5 meals and 3 happy meals.  Everything wrong.  Wasnâ__t like we order substitutes nope straight off their number system.  If the sandwich was right it was raw chicken or burnt chicken or burgers and fries were stone cold.  Not more than a mile from McDonaldâ__s to Home.  Even 2 drinks were sweet tea instead of unsweet.   
NEVER GOING BACK.   McDonaldâ__s Corporate should pull their franchise !!!!!More,Just waited 20 minutes for 3 happy meals, a double burger & 2 chicken sandwiches.  Had ordered a salad but was told they couldnâ__t make it â__because of a recall or â__something â__.  Then the chicken sandwiches can with a bunch of lettuce on them...so we took it off.  The kids didnâ__t get their drinks so I went up & waited to get them.  No apologies for any of this.  Only a few of the self serve drink options worked, & there was no catsup in the big thing with the pump.  Total fiasco when we are trying to get home in bad weather.More,Looking for fast food? Nope.  Nice but overstressed staff trying to cope with an eclectic clientele.  Go to Loves,The new manager is fantastic. Our order is always correct, the fries are fresh without being requested. The ice cream machine is always working.  The prices have gone up considerably, but the value menu helps for a basic meal. The McD app saves money too....Friendly staff. The new interior  and exterior have really given this place a nice facelift. Th new two lane drive thru is fabulous.More,Eating at McDonaldâ__s today. Why because there isnâ__t much else in chanute. 
Menu shows photos of sandwiches that I canâ__t buy. Girls at the counter donâ__t have a clue what the photos of the sandwiches might be. 
My meal came out incomplete. 
Didnâ__t bother complaining,...because Iâ__m not sure the collective store has an combined IQ average over 50.  

Food is acceptable 

Bring on the machines!More,Stopped here for late lunch thought it would be nice since it's new. It isn't. Staff was yelling slamming trays talking nonsense. Whoever is in charge has NO control or must simply just not care. Will not be back!!,Stoped here for lunch while going through town. They werenâ__t very busy but it took forever to order. It appeared the person working the register was new. She had to ask for help on every transaction for every customer. When I ordered she acted like...she had never heard of what I was ordering which was the signature sarachia chicken sandwich. My food was fresh when they brought it to me and it came fairly quick. Like other reviewers commented the restaurant could have been a bit cleaner. Particularly for no more busy than they were. 

It was ok but donâ__t know that I will stop here again.More,The restaurant was filthy. The food was sub quality and not worth the money I paid for it. The person who served me I think her name was Tamara or something was a complete B**** and talked down to me and treated me like sh**...while placing my order. My fries were undercooked and salted too heavily the burger was good. The lady forgot to give me a cup and acted like I was a complete inconvenience and like she had better things to do when I asked for it. I will not be returning and you need to get rid of that Tamara chick before she runs off more customers.More,Our food wasn't good. It was served barely warm. They were out of ketchup. The tables and floors were dirty. It was about 5:00 in the afternoon and hardly anyone was there, just some really old people. They were not busy and they didn't bother...to refill the ketchup or clean anything.More,I have been visiting this McDonald's since the day it was built. They have done a nice job keeping up with periodic remodeling, and the handicap accessibility has been improved.

McDonald's has a consistent menu, and often the least expensive prices in town. I have...not had a problem with my food being served cold, as with some of the other commentaries. My only tip is that they do not accommodate well to special requests (it is not Burger King, you can NOT have it your way), especially in the evening hours.

 The employees are most often not individuals who are committed to the position as their career choice, and thus some have less than stellar customer service skills. I do find, however, that there is at least one lead person on every shift setting the tone, and keeping a sense of order. The early morning shift crew is by far the best.

The ""Dollar Menu"" has basically evaporated. About the only thing you can consistently get for a dollar is a large soda.More,Food is up to McDonalds regular menu....served hot and good.  The servicers are pleasant, clean restrooms.  Seems to be a newer restaurant.,The food was okay. The buns tasted like rubber and my fries were cold. I ordered a large and got like 15 fries. And dollar menu?? A cheeseburger is like 1.19?,30 min wait to go home n puke from thje food. Needs closed The worst treatment of my life. Smartass employees who shld be fired. Where is the managment? We eat ate mcdonalds in the city and never more than 5 min wait and the...food is great.More,It seemed that I was served by Laurel & Hardy. Neither could get my order correct, spilled my large coffee, didn't give me a stir for my coffee when I asked for sugar, rang up my order wrong, and the bacon egg and cheese biscuits...were like rocks. I would have gone back but I was in a rush and didn't notice the biscuits until several miles away.More,Sometimes good, sometimes bad. You just never know what you will get. Hygiene of employees is questionable", I was fascinated by this robot cat waiter/waitress!,
"D'Angelo is a great lunch place.  I have also brought home subs for dinner.  I love the steak and cheese with lots of onions and lettuce and tomato.  My kids like the tuna and italian subs. The ingredients are always fresh.,This place is a disaster. Upper mgmt has their head in the sand. I was there today and it took 31 minutes for carryout (one sandwich) with only 3 people in front of me. I watched the phone ring off the hook too. They literally...won't pick up the phone if they are a little busy. I've seen this 3 of my last 4 visits. This isn't an isolated moment. Imagine a restaurant not picking up the phone for orders? My last visit they refused people saying they were too busy. The owner is running this place into the ground. It's the worst run franchise I've ever seen and embarrassing to say the least. Don't go here. You've been warned.More,My go to place when I want a quick sub, no lines, no wait, never busy! Bread was hard as a rock, complained to the staff and the girl behind the counter continued to argue back and was not going to make us happy. Manager...made us new subs with much better bread. She continued to talk under breath about us loud enough for us to hear it. Went back to try again a week later and she yells out loud make sure their bread is soft, clearly ranking on us. We told her that was not necessary and she continued to make fun. Clearly they don't care about customer service.More,Every once in a while a D'Angelo's steak and cheese hits the spot. Get the #9 with peppers, onions, and mushrooms!,We stopped for a quick lunch and weren't disappointed. Service was  quick, the staff were very obliging, and the barbecue chicken sandwich  was delicious.,We had to wait a while for lunch after we ordered.  However, it was made fresh and it was delicious.  There was a steady stream of people coming in and of the place for lunch.  

Seating available.
I had a grilled chicken and my mom...had the teriyaki chicken.  Fresh bread, solid meal.More,Was after comfort food. This fit the bill. Good cheese and chicken with mushrooms onion and peppers. Other review is right. There is no atmosphere but enjoyed some unique music here.,Liked the food and the manager was very helpful as we had never tried this place before. It was right across from our Motel.
Convenient and Reasonable price and yummy,I grabbed food here twice while on a business trip.  Food was very good.  Decent prices.  The workers had no personality but were kind.  The menu is really limited.  I figured a place with the name of D'Angelo would have a chicken parm sand but...it does not and they will not make anything that isn't on the menu board.More,The food isn't bad for a chain sandwich shop.  I've been to this location about 9 or 10 times and they only messed up my order once.  The people behind the counter try hard but sometimes get frustrated when the lunch rush hits.  They use...a process where you give your name and they call you when your order is ready.  I have seen confusion a few times when people thought they heard their name and grabbed someone elses food.  This could probably be prevented if they said the name and what was actually ordered.  I will go here if I forget to bring my lunch and need a quick bite.More,This D'Angelos is close to many office parks in the Framingham area.  They have gone through a few different managers, but this place seems to do fine and always has a nice supply of customers waiting.  I have not had any issues with my food...or the staff.More,We stopped through here after a long day of travel. The prices were decent for the area and the sandwiches were good, with a decent selection and options. The service was pretty bad. You know things are going to be awkward when you enter and...everyone behind the counter turns and just stares at you (yes, all three of them). No words, at all. In fact during the entirety of our order they didn't say a single word until the very end when one of them said ""Ready in a minute."" Since we were the only people in the entire place I felt like the sandwiches took about 3x as long as they should have and it was likely the longest I've ever waited on a sandwich in any similar place. That being said, the sandwiches were good and the prices were not bad.More,cheap sub place, not a lot of fillings put in sub unless you ask for xtra lettuce, etc.  Many options of subs.,I have been to a couple other Dâ__Angeloâ__s and this was my worst experience to date.  The service was poor with the team spending more time verbally clowning around than doing a quality job.  The Caesar salad priced at $5.99 was a very good value...and the highlight of my meal.  The toasted Italian sandwich ($7.69) was not toasted nor had any dressing on it making for a tough meal to eat when I got back to the hotel.  I have no issue when workers have fun but when it has a negative impact on my food thatâ__s a problem.More,After the long drive, and finally arriving at the hotel, I was hungry! I saw the restaurant across the street from the hotel, so I decided to try it. Very glad I did!! I ordered a large Double Pepper Steak on White, I added some...hot sauce to spice it up some more! Excellent! Great food, very little wait time, and quite filling too! The restaurant was clean, and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the products they produced. Highly recommended!!More", Maybe they were robots.,
"Have had a lot of people tell me this was a great sub shop. Stopped in today and had lunch.....NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL. You have to fill out a form about what you want, there were several types of forms to choose from. The sandwhich...wasnt anything to write home about, in my opinion a philly cheese steak should have cooked peppers not raw peppers. I will refere to Subway next time I want a good sub ! Also this place wastes ALOT of paper using the forms to order !More,I love to go here when I want a different sandwich for lunch. You pick and choose your ingredients, just like other sandwich franchises, but the service,quality, and taste are st a higher level. So are the priced, but it's worth it.,Have only been here once and tried it because a friend told me how good it was.   We happened to be in the area at lunch time and gave it a try.   Interesting way to place your order.   It was good but a bit pricey...for sandwiches but worth it.More,We'd never been, but really enjoyed the brag a bag, check off your sandwich choice and add one. Very different from most fast food places. The sandwiches were very good. Service was friendly and quick and we even got complimentary chips since it was our...first visit. Definitely will go again.More,Live the fact you can have so many options and truly make it your way. Friendly staff, connected directly to a gas station so a perfect place to grab and go OR eat inside/patio. Food was fresh and the service was pleasant. From wraps to...a sub--even a vegan can get good grubb (black bean, humus and straight veggies)More,When this place opened it was wonderful, bad management destroyed moral and tanked the restaurant.  The Current Manager has been working to improve this for over a year and is making a difference.  I try the place again each month and it is far better...than it was and with a some more TLC by the manager, it will be better than ever.  The sandwiches and salads/bowls are always made to order and if there is an issue they make it right.  The new menu is worth a try and you will not be disappointed.  If you have an issue, let them know and they will make it right.More,I've been here many times and I'll be going many more times, I'm sure. In fact, I'm considering having them cater a family reunion because their food is always fresh and their workers are always friendly.,Fresh sandwiches, custom made, quick and easy, great fountain drinks, friendly and helpful, liked their unique ordering system,Staff friendly. Subs are always very tasty but can take a little longer. The Thank You Turkey is great and The Wicked is awesome. They also offer PBJ's to help the homeless.,Stopped for something to eat when I was heading home after a day on the road. The method of ordering is unique but thorough. They cover everything you could think of to put on a sandwich. Once you have made you selections they go over...it with you and the order is sent down the line. They make the sandwiches fresh and do not skimp on quantities. It was a different experience and if I am back in the area will probably stop again it was worth it.More,I like the ordering process very much. I can see this process being beneficial to people with anxiety or different spectrum issues. Upon arrival you select a bag and a pen opposite of where the workers are located. You can look at the menu and...write exactly what you want and how you want it without pressure. Then you hand them the bag when ready, pay and go find a seat. This location had extremely friendly and helpful employees. Later in the week we ordered online to go and the order was perfect again. I had the elvis which is honey, peanut butter and bacon. That combo was delicious.More,Probably one of the best places to get subs in this area. Love the Italian. A good variety to choose from for everyone.,Mark your bag with your choices and that gets you 8 seconds at the cash register. and as long as you like to chew and spit out the flavorless sandwiches made by Whiches or whomever.

Its not the fault of the staff, its just a...meaningless pay and gag idea for people who only want to pour something into their gut to make it to the next hunger pain episode.More,After a long day at work I was looking for place to pick up something for dinner.
It has been a while since I have been to Which Wich and I am sorry I went there...
I picked out a cold sandwich called ""The Wicked""......picture shows big sandwich loaded with meats and cheeses, lettuce, tomato etc... got charged $10 for the worst sandwich my husband has ever had.  The bread was absolutely hard... he spit it out... was inedible... I offered to take a picture and send it to them... no tomato no lettuce looked nothing like the picture... just a disgrace... $10 down the drain or in the trash...  I ordered a vegetarian sandwich hot and that probably saved me from having the same experience.   My husband will NEVER eat there again... offered another sandwich... hmmm.... not a chance!... mine was good enough... with all of the competition in the sandwich arena... Namely Subway and Jersey Mike's this establishment is going to have to get it's act together... also... at least 5 employees standing there..  not another customer the entire time I was there which was at least ten minutes at app 7 pm... you would think that they would get it right... There is no way I could recommend this establishment!More,Great sandwich place. They have a large selection and good portions of ingredients. My favorite is the Pizzawich.",Cute robots moving around to deliver food. There's a robot server inside too.,
"Whilst it was still the same quality of food, the restaurant was disgusting. We had to ask to get a table wiped down. There were scraps of food and wrapping on the floor and bench seats, and the bin was overflowing. Not a pleasant dining...experience.More,Poorly managed store.. cafe serves only paper cups now ice or frappe drinks almost never available... every time I visit something is broken or not working.. today plumbing in toilet broken so couldnâ__t even wash hands, This particular store often fails and malfunctions on app...orders. Most of the time table service fails to deliver napkins with meal.. McDonaldâ__s has competitive advantage over HJ but this one sadly will fail when its monopoly in town ends soon unless they lift their gameMore,Hi everyone, I ordered the new el maco burger in a meal and some nuggest but only got chip ands nuggets in the bag, I wasn't happy at all some would say and I had to go to work. Now im hungry and have only...had some chips and nuggets.More,While I rarely eat at McDonald's, unless I am travelling, I was tempted by the $3 big Mac using their app. I'm not keen on their full prices.,Went here a few times while we were in Forster my Granddaughter loves Maccas so had to keep her happy lol,Terrible place to get in and out of. The Cappuccino was very weak and had no froth which you'ld expect. Dining room was small not enough seating.,First stop on any holiday is always Maccas . Not let down , but I was a bit dissapointed . When I asked for Table service , the girl laughed at me , and told me not to be so stupid, table service is not...available during school holidays . Fair enough , but maybe they shouldnt keep the Table Buzzers right next to the cash registers during school holidays ,then . I dont need to be told how stupid I am , when spending my hard earned cash , at a place that I show international loyalty to . New breed of teen queen .More,Dinner before travelling back to Newcastle, wasnâ__t very busy.... but absolutely filthy ð___ only 1 inside table was clean , other tables full of rubbish , people where cleaning their own tables , staff walked past it a few times looked at the mess &...went back to her Counter, they bring you your food & drinks , then you need to go & get own straws & serviettes , but the toilets where disgustingly dirty & a really bad smell, & last of all we didnâ__t get all of our food we ordered :( we were the about 7.30pm  on a Sunday nightMore,Easy to locate with good parking, friendly helpful staff and the usual menu items.  Quick and easy as it should be,table service & staff very friendly good coffee but unfortunately it still just mcdonalds food but i handy place to grab brecky,As always can rely on McDonalds for an easy and quick breakfast. Staff were very friendly and our breakfast meals were delivered to us very quickly and was nice and hot.,Had breakfast at this McDonalds on Saturday 13 January 2018 with the family. The tea came to our table piping hot in a pot and the cup came with a saucer and the milk in a separate container. The hash brown was crisp and not...oily and the rest of the food was also very well done. Clearly a very well managed restaurant with well trained staff. It's a shame this is no longer consistent across the chain of other McDonalds restaurants.More,Very little indoor seating, which we wanted since it was raining heavily. Tables were dirty and wet, and were not cleaned during the lengthy wait we had for our food. Once food came out, had to wait a long time for Mc Cafe coffee that...was ordered with it. Generally damp and grotty considering it wasn't very busy and they didn't seem understaffed. One thing with Mc Donalds though, you know what to expect with the food.More,9 time out of 10 the order is missing somthing.
The staff are rude and cut you off shut the window when you are aking a question at the drive through.
The burger are often cold, the chips are always soggy.
The Maccas at Forster...is very slack with no care taken at all.
The burgers are always over hanning ( the meat hanning off the bun and stuck with the cheese)
My cheese and bacon burger had a piece of bacon about the size of a 50cent piece on it .Why can other Maccas do it so well and Forster Maccas do it so bad.
Just because you have the only Maccas with a 30 mins drive does not mean you should take your customers for granted.More,Maccas is maccas really and don't get me wrong myself and my family enjoy an occasional treat from here, but when we do our order is usually wrong.
Or the sauces are forgotten!

The staff make u feel rushed or cut you off most of...the times in drive through.

Hopefully the manager/owner put some money in there staffs training on customer serviceMore",They even have robots which bring you your food to the table and at first i couldn't work out how the robots would be accurate with moving around but they are razor sharp and it actually made the experience more exciting!,
"Over priced and under whelming! wondered why I was given a steak knife with poached eggs that was for the dry toast and as for the avocado well letâ__s just say it wonâ__t be going brown anytime soon with the amount of lemon in itâ_¦â_¦â_¦.,Beware. These guys are operating a rort. $5.50 for a latte AND they charge to use a debit card. This kind of behavior needs to be called out.,With limited coffee options over the Xmas/New Year period, the visit to this cafe felt like price gouging. Perhaps Iâ__m finding it hard to get used to being forced to order and pay via my phone, but the system is clunky and impersonal. Further, $25...for two large coffees and some fruit toast is about 30%-40% more than Iâ__d pay nearby. The fruit toast turned up well after weâ__d finished our coffees. The payment process on your phone defaults to a 15% tip, which I found insulting given the minimal interaction with wait staff.More,Overpriced tea. Charged $7.60 for a Soy Chai. Seriously? Never seen or paid this price anywhere. I get some places charge extra for Soy but was advised Soy milk is $1 extra. Unbelievable as so many drink Soy nowadays and would only cost $3 maybe...for a carton of soy. So even without soy the chai latte is $6.60. Overpriced . Know your market and change to pricing otherwise youâ__ll lose many more customers. I definitely wonâ__t be coming back hereMore,Not very busy for a Saturday morning tells me this place was going to be average, which as it turned out I was spot on. 

The service was ok, maybe because it was not busy. I had the chilli scrambled eggs but could not taste...any chilli. Had to ask for some Tabasco. 

Coffees were good and we asked for hot and got it!!

Prices are quite high for brunch these days... something has to change.More,On arrival this large cafe had plenty of room and many empty tables, yet they made us sit waiting in the entry for ages until someone allocated us a table. As we waited the staff brushed past us to grab service items treating us as...if we were invisible. I was just about to leave when we were seated and drinks orders taken, much later our food orders were taken. The food was ok.More,We werenâ__t warmly welcomed. â__Please wait to seatedâ__, but there was a reluctance to show us to a table. Then the positives - our coffees and fruit toast were quite ok. We went to leave; it was hard to get the cashierâ__s attention. The bill...for two large coffees and one serve of fruit toast, plus 10% Saturday surcharge, plus credit card surcharge, came to $21.77. We wonâ__t be coming back - there are a number of nearby alternatives where the food is as good or better, where we are made to feel welcome, and where we are not subject to arbitrary additional charges.More,My favourite breakfast place. Food is amazing. My favourite is the Green Breaky Bowl but the chilli scrambled is also a must-try. The soy chai lattes are also fabulous. Good for gluten free options.,You have to congratulate a suburban cafe that can take 45 minutes to deliver a simple order of scrambled eggs on toast on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the cafe only 3/4 full.
The excuse? â__There was a mix up in the kitchenâ__
No kidding!...Then you get slugged with a 10% service fee because itâ__s the weekend!
For what?
Thatâ__s when most of you customers front up guys!
Itâ__s certainly not for friendly service, there isnâ__t any.
Donâ__t waste your time with this overpriced noisy eatery.
There a plenty of others in the area to choose fromMore,Dropped in for a Sunday brunch with the family, had the Hotcakes with bacon and the Muhammara. Both very nice dishes, well presented and their coffee is also quite good. 
We were lucky to grab a table out the front as the weather was perfect....Our waiter was very polite and helpful. The only let down is they do surcharge on Sunday which is a shame.More,Had a great breakfast with family . Great coffee , great service plenty of parking nearby. The scrambled egg on Toast and the avocado toast were excellent .,Visited clubhouse for Sunday morning breakfast, sat outside to enjoy the sunshine. Service was friendly and prompt. Ordered iced latte and mojo Benny. Very happy with both when they arrived.  

Only thing I wasnâ__t happy about was the 10% surcharge for weekends, especially when the...menu prices are already at the higher end. 

I would recommend to others, but unlikely to go back based on so many other venues to try.More,Came here for a family catch up with my mum, grandma and cousin. The food was nicely presented and fresh. Unfortunately my grandma ordered the chicken roll, however it didnâ__t mention the sauce was spicy, she got a bit of a shock, she likes spice...but it was a bit much for her, even though she ate it all! 
My mum ordered a long black, but was unimpressed with the taste. 
Other than that the rest of the food was tasty and the waiters and waitresses were very nice and welcoming. 
The decor is clean and open, beautiful when the sun is shining.More,Iâ__m not usually a harsh reviewer but our experience at this cafe was terrible. It wasnâ__t busy but the service was slow. I wanted a porridge dish that a friend has recommended and the waiter said it was no longer available. He suggested a granola...alternative that he said was similar. When it arrived I was stunned. Served in a half coconut shell, it consisted of a scoop of granola with mango smoothie poured on top with a small sprinkle of coconut. For $20 it was very small and lacked any taste other than mango! It also overflowed to create a right mess. I told the waiter it was not impressive and he said â__sorry you are disappointedâ__. No interest in understanding why. My friendâ__s avocado on toast was also small, lacking in flavour and cost $23! Our coffee was the smallest Iâ__ve ever received and again cost $4.20. Needless to say I will not return.More,THIS REVIEW IS A WARNING : Dear cafe loving folk- this review is a warning. This cafe adds a ten per cent surcharge just because it's Saturday and Sunday. I didn't see the small print until I was at the register paying a ridiculous 4.62...for my coffee and more than 11 dollars for a small jar smoothie. When I ordered - the waiter asked if I would like fresh chilli ( after I asked if the spiced chicken was spicy) - the chilli had no flavour or heat and I told the waiter. He brought me Tabasco sauce. The chicken was dry. At the register, I mentioned I didn't think I should pay 2.20 ( a surprise addition to the bill)  for chilli that wasn't even effective. The waiter still charged me. As a local, I will NEVER return or recommend this place. A staff member told me I am not the first to complain. Poor staff having to field complaints when the owner rakes in the outrageous ( and what I would suggest is unjustifiable) surcharge. Bitterly disappointed. I have subsequently cancelled a friends planned catch-up thereMore", A group of 10 of us enjoyed an evening of tapas and drinks (most served up by the robot).,
"Good selection of scones, caramel-laden grand cookies. Good coffee, and other snacks. Ruth was operating the shop and was very welcoming. Thanks.,For the price, service was minimal at best. Employees greeted you as if you were just another roadblock in their lives.,I enjoyed two excellent meals at Coffee Beanery while attending a conference in Albany! The service was great, and they had a wide variety of delicious entrees, sandwiches, baked goods, and sides. The hamburger combo was outstanding!,On the run, grabbed a packaged ham on rye sandwich.  The bread was dry (stale), the salty ham was limited to two-small slices that did not cover the bread, and the lettuce was wilted.  It was terrible; not to mention over-priced at $6.89, plus tax....The coffee was the smallest ""large"" I've seen and it was $2.45, plus tax.More,It's the only F&B outlet at the train station. Next closest thing would be vending machines. They are reasonably priced and have friendly staff. I'm glad the train station is not occupied by mega-companies.", I was greeted by a robot-like staff that was really passive and did not care.,
"Iâ__m from CT, but my friends and I often come into the city on the weekend to find new spots to eat and shop. Thereâ__s one place in the East Village that is very fast and a great casual meeting place, that many have probably...seen before. However, this place was new to us! I spotted them on Instagram and wanted to try it! We got the tikka fries, veggie burgers, and the fried chicken (which is gluten-free)! Healthy and affordable. Highly recommend if youâ__re ever walking around downtown!More,Came here for an event and tried a variety of curry burgers. My favorites were the chicken and the vegetarian. The paneer was a bit dry as was the salmon. The concept is great though and I look forward to trying again as they refine...the concept.More,I have had bad experience with this place twice. The restaurant is apparently open till 9 PM. The first time we reached at 8.40 PM and nobody allowed us inside saying that they were closing soon. We even requested for a take away but they...bolted the door from inside.
The next time we reached at 8 PM and were again kicked out saying the place is reserved for private dinners during the weekends. This information is not mentioned anywhere on their website. How would somebody know this?! 
The staff is too rude as if they serve free food. Would never ever go back here again!More,It was quick, which is what I want for lunch. Average to good Indian food.  But the girl who served me just went through the routine like she's done it a million times, and not like I'm a living person. Same with the guy at...the register. Bored, indifferent, give me the 10 bucks and I'll give you a receipt if you want one. Then, no kidding, he knocked the bag of food towards me like it was a basketball. How can I have any respect for this food that I'm putting in my body if they don't?  My take? They don't like their job but they can't find anything else. I hope they find a nice job in a factory.More,Great for a fast, cheap meal. They have many different options and flavors, all arrayed in an open bar as they put your tiffin together for you. I loved the combination of sweet and spicy. While not completely authentic - and perhaps not very fresh?-...it was a tastier stop than a corner deli or sandwich shop. Good if you're looking for something fast!More,Interesting twist but moves too far from what the original..Dosa purists will have trouble digesting this chipotle meets dosa fusion.,Trying to be healthy doesn't mean sacrificing flavor or value. Dosa wrap is the size of a newborn baby. 8 chutneys and garnishes mean you can craft the flavors you are looking for. A varied menu right next to Washington Square park means lunch in...the park. Highly recommended.More,I had never had this before.  The employees educated me on how to choose....and it was fun and awesome!!!!,I went twice for lunch on weekdays.Both times, we were served quickly. All the food is ready-made on a buffet line, so you only have to pick your options. I did not find the sauces to be very good, but you can order several and...get them on the side. Instead of burrito-style, I decided on the dosa on the side and the entrees served over rice. Less than $10 per person.More,I cannot praise this place enough! We found this place after looking for a unique, inexpensive to eat around the NYU area. Overall, it is a sort of an â__Indian twist on Chipotleâ__ but so much better! I went with four friends, three of whom...are Indian, so they suggested I try the dosa (the menu describes it as a sort of sourdough crepe). I opted for the Tiffin Bowl with Lemon Brown Rice and a dosa on the side. From there, I was split between wanting all of the toppings so the server was incredibly patient in describing the flavors and ingredients of each one. (The menu has short descriptions, but I had never had Indian food so I was asking pretty detailed questions.) I unintentionally made a vegetarian bowl by choosing the Egg Whites and Kale & Vegan Cheese â__ which were amazing! I had the Mung Beans atop the rice, then came the chutneys. Again, the server and owner took time to describe them to me, which resulted in the Mango in the bowl, Spinach & Yogurt on the side of the bowl, and Spicy and two others in cups on the side! Finally, I topped the bowl with Carrots and Lettuce, which provided a nice refreshing crunch to the bowl. A big plus was the large container of water with cups since I drink a ton of water during meals and always appreciate when restaurants have this. 
Now how did it taste? WOW. The meal was an incredible punch and balance of flavors without any one part being too overpowering. I ended up stirring everything together and dumping the cup of Spicy sauce on top (I found it to be pretty mild since I love spicy food), but my Indian friends opted to keep everything separate. I learned that the proper way to eat it is to rip off a small part of the dosa, use it to pick up a bite of food, eat it, then drink a sort of curry sauce(?) on the side â__ you can ask the servers what this was since I missed it when I was going down the line. I found it amazing that each part of the dish was delicious in and of itself, but the flavors were really well balanced when mixed together. Also a huge plus is that when you check in on Yelp, you get a side of Baked Kale Chips, which are seasoned with some Indian spices.
Perhaps the best part was the friendliness of the owner. While ordering, he was there to provide some insight into the food choices, but he also came over to our table to see how we were doing. He told us about his vision for the restaurant, and we enthusiastically asked him to open a site by our alma mater, Rutgers University in NJ (heâ__s looking into it!!). I canâ__t wait to tell everyone about this awesome place and will definitely be back with friends when weâ__re in the neighborhood.More,Loved the food here. I got lemon rice, beef entr_©e, and a combination of sauces -- mild and hot sauces together are sinfully good, plus raita and carrots. Very tasty and doesn't make you feel lethargic like typical NYC Indian fare (and the dosa isn't...really heavy like a typical burrito). 

Went back a second time and tried the baked egg whites, which are actually really good. 

The first time I tried the ""responsible"" hot sauce and the sprouted mung beans with spinach sauce; when I went back I graduated to the ""not responsible"" (!) hot sauce â__ awesome and truly hot â__ with sprouted mung in tamarind tomato sauce. Both times there was a *really* nice balance of flavors. 

Great vibe, great concept. Went with a group of friends on my second visit and everyone was hooked.  

Prices are really reasonable and it's healthy. Gluten-free to boot.More,I walked into this place unplanned after meeting a friend as I was in the mood for South Indian food & saw this place right in front of me. Thought I'd give it a try & am glad I did. Its a very unique take...on South Indian food. Very tasty healthy and reasonably priced. The manager was very friendly & actually sat with me to explain the concept of the restaurant & gave me a free promotional lassi. I will come again with my wife & also recommend it to other people. Its not your regular greasy Indian food. Go give it a try. You'll love it.More"," Kura relies heavily on tech interfaces and robotics for checking in, ordering, table service and checkout.

They now offer takeout on their pizza,We went for the prime rib and crab legs special.  Our prime rib was ordered medium rare, but came out between medium and medium well done.  The prime rib, salad bar, baked potato, and margarita were good.  The crab legs were small, spindly, cooked in...too much crab boil, and were very salty.  The crab legs were very disappointing and definitely not worth the extra charge.More,We went in around 8:00 pm on a Thursday and ordered a couple of burgers along with some onion rings. Burgers were excellent, tasted like fresh ground beef (not frozen) and onion rings very good. We had Dr Peppers and they were the best that...I had or my wife had tasted in several years (20-25 years)--maybe due to the bar dispensing them and they kept their lines clean???.  Great place to eat and reasonable--definitely worked for us.More,TJ's is a mom and pop steak house and bar that has real local flavor. Five miles out on hwy 63 past wa-mart, this gem is worth a look.

This is by far my favorite place in the West Plains area!!!!,A cut above the average chain burger.  Good sandwich and plate options.  Good drink variety if you like.

As noted by other reviews, they allow smoking. After dinner we enjoyed a cigar after a great canoe trip on the North Fork of the White River.  The food was an honest steak, served well and by friendly staff...while we watched the Royals play. We also enjoyed a free Apple Beer that was given away by the bar staff. 
Is TJ's four star dining? No - but it isn't priced that way or pretending to be. Steak dinner, three beers and a freebie: $23. Hard to beat!More,We ate here with family and the food was pretty good, but the smoking that is allowed inside just made the experience not very good overall.  If you don't like restaurants that allow smoking, probably best to choose a different place.,This is probably scored about right for the area.  It is an older restaurant and the food is okay.  If smoke bothers you at all, don't go here.  It has a bar area attached and they allow smoking.  There is no real barrier to stop...the smoke from rolling over.  The waitress was very friendly but this place is nothing special.  We were the only ones eating in the food area at about 730 pmMore,Seven of us dined here on Friday, July 3rd, after long days of travel in from all over the East coast for a funeral Saturday morning. I never caught our server's name but she was wonderful. Very attentive and the food was great for the...price point. I started with a caesar salad that was very fresh and enjoyed the blackened grouper sandwich for my entree. The rest of the party enjoyed a variety of other menu items ranging from starters of an onion blossom and beef brisket to sirloin and filets for dinner. So why 4 stars not 5? The brisket had a fair amount of fatty inedible portions in the serving and quite a few side dishes came to the table cold. Service was so great though I would give them another try if ever in town again, and would highly recommend this restaurant to families or couples looking for a casual, comfort food cuisine meal at a great value for the money.More", There is a cute little robot that delivers your food.,

Also this location is pretty easy on and off Highway 101, if you are traveling both North or South, is located right next to the Marriott.More,We stopped for a quick bite going home from our trip across The Central Coast on Sun. November 29th, 2020. A bit off the beaten path, but the restaurant was new and exceptionally clean. I got my Sausage McMuffin & Egg sandwich (My uncle got...the other as it was â__2 for $5â__) and a large Coke for a buck. Drive thru, ate in the lot. Very Satisfying!! Thanks for reading my review of McDonaldâ__s Buellton. Hugs!! Joe G. Bear - Redondo Beach, CAMore,If are eating outside at 11:00 AM or 1:00PM, then some sun will reach your face or the top of your head.  The earlier or later, the more more sun you will receive.  But I did enjoy my Cheeseburger, fries, and CokeCola.  I was much...needed late breakfast or just a bit early lunch.More,Having only 20 mins. for a quick bite before the movies next door at the Parks Plaza Theaters we ordered a filet fish sandwich and I asked for the So. West salad with no chicken or cheese being vegan.  Asked for the Newmans Southwest dressing...on the side and it was really good and had a nice kick to it.  However I ordered an iced coffee and it came with milk and sugar already in it so being vegan I refused it.  To get plain iced coffee would take ten minutes so instead I took a bottle of water.
With machines to take your orders, the staff seemed to have not much to do and chatted amongst themselves.More,Fairly easy in/out coming from #101 going either way.  It's always been clean whenever I go in there.  Service ok as well.  Clean restrooms.,Another burger joint that is the same wherever you go. Same items, same prices, so so help some of whom can be rude.,We tried to order at the drive through and the â__senioritaâ__ the had at the order microphone could NOT speak English!!!!!
She tried but had a heavy Hispanic accent with no English enunciation at all. We tried twice to order and just left in disgust....This experience was insulting and made us feel raw with disgust about what is happening - what has happened - to our precious country.More,McDonald's always provides a reasonable breakfast and coffees to please everyone.  Reasonable eats always available.,Bathroom was a mess. Glad we only stopped in for a soda before we hit the road. I've seen gas stations with cleaner restrooms.,After over indulging on yummy Danish pastries and great food at non-chain places, we wanted just a light evening meal.  McDonalds fit the bill, especially for the grandkids and my wallet.,Very clean and organized McDonald's with friendly staff and grass areas to walk your dog if one has a pet that needs exercise.  Clean restrooms and room to drive down with an RV and towed vehicle. An RV can go down main inbound driveway go...to the far end of driveway and make a right turn parking parallel against fence line then easy right turn going back up to street along Hotel driveway.  We have done this in the past and checked again to verify access this week.More,This McDonald's is right off Hwy 101. Fast drive thru, service polite, food hot. Quick and easy. Lots of parking areas, and an outside sitting area.,We had breakfast here and went for our usually, which is oatmeal, which we really enjoy at other McDonalds, but we did not enjoy it here. We also had the parfait which we really didn't care for either. We love McDonald's fudge sundaes and were...in the mood for one, one of the nights we were visiting and then remembered we did not enjoy the food, so decided we would pass on the sundae. It was late, so we probably saved a few pounds too.More,Nice outside area with plenty of parking. Food is what you'd expect from a fast food joint. Clean floors & restrooms, friendly and helpful employees. Conveniently located close to the 101 freeway and next door to a nice hotel Marriott"," Kids will enjoy seeing the robots in action as they deliver your order, and they actually y?_?all?_?s delivered our drinks!",
"Our group of 5 arrived on a beautiful Sunday evening and were pleased to be seated outside fairly quickly. All the staff were friendly and pleasant but we wished we were offered a chance to get second beverages. The meals were good - Cubano sandwiches...for 2 in our group, burger, salmon sandwich and fish tacos for others. The view of the action in the neighborhood and at Madison Beach on Lake Washington is a definite draw.More,This is a very nice unpretentious spot in the beautiful Madison Park neighborhood.  The best part for us that our dog was allowed inside with us! We all enjoyed our dinners. We will definitely return with our doggie.,We had a great lunch on the outdoor terrace with a nice lake view.  The service was excellent and the food was beautifully prepared, top quality and reasonably priced.  It was an exceptional experience.,We had two servers. The guy was attentive but Tiffany, the female, was just terrible. I accidentally spilled my beer all over the table. When we informed Tiffany, she went outside and never returned to clean the table. Finally, when we got her attention, this...robotic server asked if I wanted another beer?  We wanted a clean table. The guy graciously came over and did his job. The sliders were so so, without any aioli sauce until we asked. The baked potato was also okay. We will not return. She was entirely indifferent. I asked her name. She mumbled and disappeared yet again.More,Taco Tuesday -- the pork tacos are juicy and delicious. And the margaritas, ahhh.
Come for Happy Hour: Buffalo chicken wings and coconut shrimp appetizers are consistently tastier than those at the tourist traps. Crab soup in a bread bowl gets groans of pleasure. The...spicy mussels are also amazing. The hamburgers are supposed to be good, but I always end up getting the seafood. Service is fast and friendly.

It's small and most of the diners are local people who come several times a week. See the real Seattle.More,Arriving back for the north, we were hungry for something substantial so decided to walk to Madison Park. Had the steak, potato and broccoli! Perfect selection, taste, price! Highly recommend this place.,We had a group of five for lunch, and it was quite good.

First off, our server took  our orders and all the special requests without writing anything down. Dishes delivered exactly as ordered.

Next our lunches. Killer Cubano sandwich, pulled pork, chowder, Reuben.

We...will definitely be back!More,Staff were pleasant and service good. We did not eat here. Without a doubt the best of the bars we tried in the area for a pre-dinner drink. Having said that the others were not very good ! Notwithstanding this point we enjoyed the experience...although we were there during a very hot and humid spell and if seating was not available outside you could not stay for long inside unless there is a breeze..More,Had a light lunch, sitting outside on a lovely day, with prompt, friendly service. We had beef sliders and a tomato/mozzarella salad. Happy Hour prices all day and we felt they were very reasonable,Oh yeah. Maybe not for foodies. But it certainly is casual, friendly and the wait staff is super nice. We were there on a warm Tuesday evening. The view of the lake is delightful. $2 tacos. $5 margaritas. Fun place.,Great pub along Lake Washington with a very good menu and nice beer selection. The wait staff was very attentive.  I would return for sure.,we come to Seattle often and we always make sure to go to McGilvra's.  Taco Tuesday is good, everyday Happy Hour is terrific.  Good food, good drinks, good service.  But please, please do something about the bathrooms,,Service was good, wine was good, view was good, food was good but not as represented in the menu.
Three out of five of us ordered the Salmon with Asparagus over Risotto, the three orders had no Asparagus. We pointed this out to the wait...staff after we were served and were told ""we are out of Asparagus"". It would have been nice to have been told this fact and been given the option of ordering something that was as presented in the menu. Disappointing.More,Used to be pretty good food, now it's overcooked and dry.  The mussels are good but beef well done and tough.  Service slow, too busy watching sports (esp. soccer) on TV and yakking with the regulars at the bar.,McGilvra's Irish Pub and Restaurant is located in the very tony Madison Park neighborhood of Seattle.

The menu displays a very wide variety of appetizers and dinner entrees, such as:

Nachos, Hummus, and Taco Salad

Burgers

Traditional Irish Dinners such as Guiness Beef Stew, Shepherd's...Pie, and Corned Beef And Cabbage

Italian Specialties like Lasagna and Pesto Chicken Fettuccini.

There's something here for everyone!

We were here on a Thursday evening and sat in a booth.  It was quiet enough that we could have an intimate conversation with our friends.

I've been here several times and have always had a terrific experience.

Dinners are moderately priced and are a good value for the area.More", Robot bringing food really cool and my times were perfect.,
"I know I shouldnâ__t have high expectations But every time (maybe 3 times a year) I  go to this location Iâ__m charged a different price for the special order  I get. This visit my onion rings were disgusting and the pop was flat. And they...wanted to charge me for the sweet & sour sauce (no where else does). This location is always messy. Never going back.More,It's Burger King! nothing special. drive-thru tends to be slow even if its only one car in. The service inside is ok, they do tend to make mistakes while taking your order more often than they should but the manager is always there and shes...very nice and fixes them quickly.
they do have good deals on sometimes too so its not bad for a quick snack at night.More,Dropped in with my daughter on Dec.12th and the young girl (who I assumed was new) had mad a mistake on the ladys order ahead of us.  She had undercharged the woman by $1.51.  Two other woman came out to the register and really made...the poor girl look like a fool, and then told the lady that if she wanted the larger item she would have to pay the $1.51.  Apparently, this restaurant will go bankrupt without this money. I couldn't believe it. Two people to fix this.  If I was that lady (who had a large order) I would have cancelled the entire thing.  Then woman fixing it really would have had something to void.More,A great affordable place for breakfast just 6 or 7 bucks nice light spacious dining area with easy parking access and friendly service great value for money,Great friendly service for a fast food chain. Reliable quality of food. Not a lot of seating but it works for the location. Staff work hard to provide good customer service.,The service here was very good and fast. The food was hot and good but I found my burger had a little too much sauce on it and was quite sloppy. The restaurant was very clean and you could tell they kept it that way,When I say food was good, it was typical for Burger King and it was hot and fresh. Place was clean no issues. Staff was friendly and good. However, there were 4 of us and about 12 in front of us in the line and...it took over 20 minutes to order. They had one staff person on the tills. They only have two tills but they never opened the other one. I thought that was very strange and a bad decision. There were some students behind us on their lunch break that gave up and left.More,The wait staff were friendly and engaging and appeared to be really well trained. I love Big King Sandwiches and the ones I had tonight were the best ever. Hot juicy and well put together.,I like me a Whopper.  But I ate here twice while working in Bayer's Lake and regretted it both times.  Slow service.  Good was greasy; place not as clean as, you know, it's famous competitor.  Was drawn in by the price; hope I will be...wiser next time.More,Stopped here for breakfast,food was typical Burger King.Although it wasn't busy they seemed to be struggling,they had 1 speed for service Slow..,I have never been served fresh hot food here. Lacks in cleanliness, Cool that it has a small kids play area, but it was pretty gross. Washroom was very dirty. Staff could care less.,Fast friendly service new dining room big breakfast reasonably priced 2 eggs bacon 2 slices toast hash browns and coffee 6 bucks plus tax,They need to clean that childrens area as it is the only reason 50% of the people go there. It was filthy and my child was furious when we saw it and had to leave before ordering. Instead took her to Morris East on Larry...Uteck and to the indoor playground just across the street. Was worth the money to avoid the extra strain on Nova Scotia health care that play area in Burger King would have caused my child and countless others. Too bad.... we used to take her to play there all the time. :(  Just bring your own Lysol and a team of Molly maids and your good to go.....More,I love the puddings from Burger King, I tend to pick one up after work on a Sunday. However for about a month and half the ice cream machine was broken (not fixed so fair enough) but now they have no stock of the hotties...or waffles at all. I asked why and was told someone had 'forgot' to order them? Great.....More,No problem with the food if you like burgers, it's the company BURGER KING and its non-existent customer service. No Disabled Parking and only ONE HOUR car parking, to order food, eat food and drive out of car park or you get a parking charge...notice (FINE) from its Camera  Controlled Timed Parking Company. 
My advice would be, go to McDonald's Halifax, they have Disabled Parking and NO PARKING RESTRICTIONS. You can eat at your leisure, no requirement to rush.More","The waitress explained how the tablet worked and asked if we would be ok being served by a robot- very cool! The waitress explained how everything worked and asked if we wanted to try out the robot waiter experience, and of course we said yes. Food came out quickly and it was a nice",
"We chose the platinum package for a moderate selection of food variety. Good meats, seafood and several types of beef servings.  Go there only when you are hungry.,The food is delicious, the Korean-style dipping sauce is not suitable for the meat. Seafood sauce. I want to make it taste Thai style. It's very delicious.,Food is fine and at the best. But since the receptionist to the waiter, no smile and being acted like their servants. Worst service you can imagine even at buffet. As buffet, not much services are expected but the worst!!!,This is a conveyor belt steamboat or hotpot buffet. Fresh meat, fish, balls, prawn, tofu, vegetables, noodles etc are put on small plates on a conveyor belt aka the sushi manner. You can select individual pot or share a large pot for a group. Tom...yum or clear broth can be selected. In addition, there are sushi, tempura, fried rice and even chinese pau available. Free flow of soft drinks and ice cream and fruits. All for 400 baht and to be completed in 1hr 20min. Pretty innovative...More,Many selection of ingredients for your soup pots, with option of clear or creamy tom yam soup

Reasonable price of THB299 on sunday lunch

Love it,Stopped by here to grab lunch once again and it was satisfying as usual. Really enjoyed their buffet offerings. I like the kani salad, found myself going for thirds as well as the tamagoyaki and the custard bun.,For 400 bath you can eat for 2 hours refilling your drinks and have unlimited sushi and hotpot with seafood, meat and vegs on the train. I love it but don't expect tasty food. It is tom yam soup and lots of dips.,After a long day of shopping, we met our thai friends here for dinner. It's all you can eat and you have 1.5 hours to do so. We got a big pot with 2 different types of broth and made our own dipping sauce of...garlic, onion and chilli sauce.  The uncooked food is on a conveyor belt and you just pick up whatever comes your way. There was a good selection of veggies, meat and fish tofu.  There were many people eating that day so the turnaround for the food was a good pace and everything looked fresh. I avoided the clams and squid though.  There were drink dispensers for many different types of drinks, ice cream, steamed buns and an array of sushi and noodles. 

The price for all you can eat was reasonable but of course, when compared to thai food that you can get on the streets and markets, it was expensive. But it was a convenient dinner at the mall.More,There's really no other way to put it. The prices are higher than any local places but the meat and everything else feels/tastes extremely cheap. The fish from the sushi buffet tasted like some aquarium fish just gave up on life and died, only to...get picked up again after a week and served at the restaurant. The meat was all tasteless and fat and somehow managed to taste the same (fat and boring) even though I tried the pork/lamb/cow. The only thing good was the cola dispenser with ice that you could take en masse.More,Seafood was terrible, smelly and quite bad. Not many kind of food on the train and also a few foods at the trays. The main thing was not many customer at that time so foods on the train was around many times with no temperature...checked.More,I thought it was a bit expensive at first, but then realized it was only $10 for all I could eat sushi and suki-soup.  We were hungry so we went for it.  We could have called for a dial up discount, but we didn't have...a Thai SIM.  We were given a table and one and a half hours to eat.  Little plates of meat and vegetables cruise by on a track and there are several kinds of sushi and tempura to chose from.  There were also french fries, but they weren't at all fresh and seemed out of place.  There are soft drinks on tap and ice-cream or steamed buns for dessert.  We three were stuffed and needed a nice long walk after.  Give it a shot at Siam Centre as well.More,Went to the branch in Siam Centre. First time eating at a Japanese Buffet. Well worth the money, quite inexpensive. Good spread of main course, desserts, drinks.,I went to the MBK branch located on the 7th floor. Always busy have to wait. It's Thai  and Jaoanese food. I like the steam boat more. Food were on the conveyer belt , pick whatever you like and repeat. There are Japanese food like...rice, sushi, tempura, and other fried stuff. Eat as much as you want for 350 baht. I enjoyed the food very much.More,We have tried two of the stablishments and I must say that it has been a taste gratifying experience. In addition to the small buffet, customers can boil their own food in a personalized hot pot, adding flavour and ingredients to their like.,For about 350 baht (or 300 - 315 baht if you buy a 1 year membership card for 129 baht) a person you fill yourself with a soup pot buffet and sushi.

The restaurant doesn't give a very hygienic impression. This has not deterred me...from coming back now and then. I have been staying in Thailand- SE asia a long time, and below average hygiene doesn't scare me that easy. Also : the concept is that you cook your food yourself, so it doesn't need 5 star cleanliness.

The dishes at the conveyor belt : I only go for vegetables (to give extra taste to the stock) and ""pure"" fish, pork or beef. The processed fish balls, processed meat, noodles,... are just cheap fillings which I don't trust anyway.
The sushi : I eat that at other places.

With my system of picking out the dishes, I can eat worth the money in weight of food. And because everything is cooked, it's difficult to overeat. Even completely full, you will be up and ""running"" within an hour.

On my last visit spotted 2 cockroaches : tests my tolerance to the limitMore",He says they have a robot that walks around when MIT classes are in session.,
"Ordered ahead so we would not have to wait. Just a simple bobox. 8 piece chicken, 3 sides (all fries) and a half gallon sweet tea. Order says ready at 1:45. Get there at around 2. Order not ready. Not even started. Waited at cashier...spot for 10 minutes before someone finally came over and asked us what we wanted.  Rolled her eyes when I said I orderd online, then proceeded to walk away without saying a word. There was  no tea, it had to be made. Looked like maybe 4 people working the entire restaurant. Tables dirty, floors dirty, unrinal over flowing in mens room, tp all over the floor. Took maybe 15 more minutes to get our order. We asked for honey mustard and the response was ""It's all gone, we got some ranch if you want that"". Hmm, ok how about barbecue? ""No thats all gone too. Just got ranch"". Chicken was cold and rubbery. Fries greasy and cold. This one we will lnot go back to.More,Fantastic biscuits.  My favorite is their Country Ham and Egg.  My only complaint is that there are no Bojangles locations in the Tampa, FL area.,Camped out here for a while taking advantage of free Wi-Fi. Had a late lunch and coffee. Staff was friendly and restaurant relatively clean (for fast food joint). Problem was with wait time. Even a simple order seemed to be an ordeal. Very disorganized behind...the counter. Chicken was okay but BoRounds were greasy (obviously cooked when oil was not hot enough). Some customers had to be seated and wait for food to be ready. Coffee was never replenished when empty. Overall poor experience.More,This place sucks!!! Went there for lunch before work, went inside because drive they was backed up, waited 30 minutes for my food!! Had to ask the cashier to change gloves,Any restaurant you visit can be so busy you wonder how is it going to end! This was the case here. Drive thru wrapped around the building, inside people ordering both breakfast & lunch at the same time, yet the whole staff was focused &...worked through the ""RUSH""
Great job!!!!More,Stopped in at Bojangles on Stratford for breakfast. Went inside, the cashier/manager was trying to run the business, wait on customers and push out food. He was not very nice or attentative. Nothing was explained. He just put in whatever you asked for. The place...needs a few renovations. Even though I waited about 10 minutes on my food. My cajun chicken biscuit was cold and the meat tough.More,So, I went to this location for lunch.  I got in line at the drive-thru, which was a big mistake.  The drive thru has curbs on both sides, so if someone is behind you, you can't get out of line.  I sat in one spot...for literally 20 minutes.  I know this because I watched the clock in my car.  By the time I got to the speaker, I figured since I waited that long, I may as well wait a little longer.  I mean, how much longer than 20 minutes could it be?

Well, from the time I finally got up to the speaker and gave my order, I had to wait another 15 minutes to finally get my food, which was sparse.  The pieces of chicken were very small, and the pack of fries they gave me had 10 fries in it.  10 FRIES! Yes, I counted them.More,Started at drive-through and cars were absolutely not moving.  It was 11:30 am and about 10 cars in front of me.  I was blocked behind by another car.  After waiting an eternity, finally got to where I could get out of line and decided it...would be quicker to go in.  Huge mistake!  3 people in front of me and girl at register was taking forever.  I patiently waited, and waited and waited and finally placed my order.  Moved on down where everyone else was waiting for their order too.  Then they said they were out of supremes.  There was the problem. I'm sure outside and inside.  Who doesn't have supremes ready at lunch??  Finally after another eternity they asked if I would take tenders.  Of course, I just wanted to eat.  Asked for my large tea cup and they gave me the wrong size.  Had to wait for them to finally give the right one.  Went to sweet tea dispenser and you guessed it, empty!!  Had to ask them to fill it behind the counter and wait again.  After at least 30-40 minutes, I left with tenders and a sweet tea that was not sweet at all.  Will never go back to that BoJangles again!!More,Wonderful selection of quick food items for any time of day.  Once you have stopped by a Bojangles, you will be sure to come back again!,I'm not normally out very early but I was this morning and wanted a simple breakfast. I got a couple country ham biscuits and they were amazing. The only thing is that it was too much to eat, at least for me. One would have...been enough !!!More,Was heading out of town for the day and needed a little breakfast.  Stopped at Bojangles for some bacon biscuits and some cajun filet biscuits.  Both very fresh and very good.  Service was also quick.  We went through the drive through.,Fast Service, and good quality food.  The breakfast meal was fast and good at a great price.  Will eat there again,I always stop by this Bojangles when I am in the area shopping. I usually get a sausage biscuit or the Cheddar Bo biscuit. Their bo rounds are also very good. The only thing I don't like is they put an insane amount of seasoning...salt on their fries. ( I know you can order with lite salt, but sometimes I forget). They a good variety of breakfast meats, with or without eggs. The pecan twists are also very good. Prices are very reasonable.  Lunch and dinner are also served here. Chicken is one of their staples, as well as dirty rice, pinto beans, slaw, ect.More,The food is tasty and the people are always friendly. This place is a must visit when we visit from Maine because we don't have a Bojangles' up North.,I have to say, I do believe Bojangles offers the best fast food breakfast. My Cajun fillet biscuit is moist and actually tastes like chicken. The sausage gravy and biscuits are good. We come here often when we travel and don't have time for a...full service restaurant. Love the Christian music on Sunday morning.More",They had a robot to help serve- transport dishes - fun. Locals drive more than 100km just to see the working robot in action.,
"Best food love the taste serving behavior of staff everything superb, They have a variety of food options out of which I have a taste of their; 
ð__¸Tomyam Seafood ð__² 
ð__¸Asian Platter 
ð__¸Sweet and Sour Chicken
ð__¸Vegetable fried Rice,Last night I was at @asianplates Restaurant that is located at Mina St - Al ZahiyahE13 - Abu Dhabi
I wanted to try @asianplates food from a very long time ð___So yesterday night I had finally got the opportunity to indulge my self in their...delicious authentic Thai food , Chinese food,and asian cuisine ð___
The Restaurant has professional Thai chefs all the way from Thailand .
My last night's dinner included some of top sellers from @asianplates menu ð___
Asian platter:It had Prawn Tempura ð__¤,toast breadð___, Spring Rolls ð___ Chicken satay with delicious peanut ð_¥_ sauce ð_¤¤
Tomyam seafood:was a type of hot and sour Thai soup, with shrimp (prawn). Tom yum has its origin in Thailand. the hot and sour flavours, with fragrant spices and herbs were generously used in the broth ð__²very good to taste and satisfying ð_¤¤
Veg and tofu clear soup ð__²clear soup loaded with the goodness of veggies,glass noodles and I had asked for some chicken aswel in the soup for my son very tasty and healthy indeed ð___
Chicken cashewnuts was tender stir-fried chicken and roasted cashews in garlic sauce tasted Devine with white jasmine rice ð___ð___

Thanks to our Server TROY for being so helpful and hospitable.
Guy's do check out @asianplates page for more updates .
They are available on @zomatouae @talabatuae @deliveroo_ae 
Thank you @asianplates for the lovely Experience ð___More,Food was really awesome. Didn't expect the taste and spices this perfect. A must visit restaurant for sure. Service and ambience are above the mark,Good Food, I loved their seafood salad very much. The restaurant is next to my place therefore so good for me.,By far, this is the most delicious Thai food I have ever tried. Their Nasi Goreng and Tom Yum Soup is very delicious. The ingredients are generously added on each dish giving a mouth-watering explosion of flavors. Their Pad Thai is also something you need...to try, and everyone's favorite Mango and Sticky Rice is undeniably delectable. Their place is small but is elegantly decorated and hygiene is unquestionably guaranteed as the place is very clean. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Overall, Asian Plates is very much highly recommended!More,A small but cozy ambiance restaurant with a taste of Asian food to serve specially Thai Cuisine. The only main concern for this restaurant is that you have to wait long time or hour perhaps for your order I think maybe itâ__s because they donâ__t...have enough staff to serve and prepare the food specially when itâ__s getting busy you really have to spend and have a patience to wait for your order but once you taste the food well what I can say itâ__s worth the wait. A big thanks to one of their staff name Roy for being so accommodating and friendly.More,The restaurant name is â__ Asian Plates.â__ We really like the duck noodles soup and we tried it twice. It was delicious like having one in Bangkok local street. The restaurant is very small can only fit 12-15 customers at the the time. It was...noisy when the kitchen staff making fruit juice or anything involved with the blender. Easy to find car parking spot in the afternoon (paid parking though). Staff were very friendly. Food is reasonable price.More,Real name is Asian Plates.
Restaurant inside is very small but in winter time you can eat outside.
Not chic, not elegant, not touristic  but  clean and really thai ( 3 thai cooks). They serve Asian plates from different countries but I just tried Thai...food. Same taste of Thai street restaurants: I like it .... 
someone wrote that not enough chili in the dishes: I love extra spicy food and this is the place !!!
Donâ__t ask for very hot if you are not well trained!!!!
Excellent green papaya salad and hot holy basil ( chicken or beef.... unfortunately no pork) with rice and fried egg . Very large quantity of food.
Cost of this meal ( I have just ask for the bill) 75 dirhams = 20US $
Excellent food/money valueMore,This visit our second time, previously we went there as a group so doesn't feel anything but this time among all there staff only one who smile at us and felt happy to have us there, and the rest was just like a zombie. Took...the order then left, drop the cutlery then left, drop the food and took the payment and left. Even we said thank you while leaving.... not them . The food also not like before, food quality have slightly dropped !! It was not the first time there, but it was the last time.More,Started off very well, with excellent and flavoursome meals. But has been steadily going downhill. Maybe the owner needs to take a little more interest in the way the meals are prepared.
The balances of the flavours, so essential in good Thai cuisine, is completely...off. The ingredients are uniformly good, but the meals are decidedly unsatisfactory.More,I visited this restaurant only once. They serve Thai, Singapore, Philippines and Malaysian food. I ordered stir fried vegetables. Their serve size was tiny, which forced me to order fried rice. The dish was tasty but was too pricy. Being not a big eater, I...wonder how many dishes a big eater has to order at this restaurant, may be minimum 3 dishes. Not too great to visit this place again.More,We had heard good things about Asian Plates (someone need to fix the spelling mistake on Trio Advisor!). However, the food we ordered was decidedly average, the Som Tam salad had the makings of greatness - lovely fresh ingredients and a good portion size, but...lacked any chilli whatsoever and the sugar content was off the scale. Who ever heard of a som tam that was NOT spicey?!?!?! The Singapore fried noodles were similarly lacking in flavour and spice, the blandest we have tested in Abu Dhabi. Our sweet and sour prawns were just ok, but once again really lacked solid flavour. A disappointing meal.More,Asian Pilates has been around for some time now- however it is only recently that we tried their food. We had a steamed Dim sum (we have had better dim sums at better prices elsewhere), Chicken satay (average), Chicken cashew nut  (the best among the...dishes we ordered), Pad Thai Chicken noodles (not bad) and Egg Fried rice (quantity too less). 

If Asian Pilates is trying to position itself as a competition to the older players in Abu Dhabi Chinese/ Asian restaurants they need to either improve their quality substantially to match the prices or increase the quantity if that is not possible.  As of now both quality and quantity are disappointing for the menu prices.More","Wonderful service, including the robot Food Runner that carried the food to our table. Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and a robot we enjoyed as it dashed around as a server.",
"On my recent visit, I ordered my usual - a six-inch tuna on parmesan oregano bread.
       The staff was completely rude and unprofessional.
         The first person coughed very strongly onto his or her arm while making my sandwich, and was about to keep making my...sub with all the germs and maybe virus on her hands, as she of course wiped the coughed-on arm after sneezing.
         I politely asked that the co-worker finish my sandwich.
          If a person is coughing, he or she should not be making sandwiches. Isn't that common sense?
            The second employee then put a very tiny amount of vegetables on each time. It was the smallest amount of vegetables I'd ever seen put on by a Subway worker in my over 40 years of going to Subway. I had to keep asking her to put more on. Each time, she added almost nothing, as if she was intent on giving me the tiniest portion imaginable. She was so rude, and kept mumbling something nasty in Thai to her coughing cohort.
            At one point, she said in the most cold, officious manner: ""Standard!""
              Unbelievable. The standard portion for what? Ants?
                Those two are some of the rudest Subway staff I've seen anywhere. They need to be seriously retrained and monitored. If they continue to act as they did to me today (with not a single other customer there; in fact, I was their first) then they should be fired.More", I was impressed with how systematized and robotic the staff?_?s answer was. Too bad they didn?_?t employ a real robot. Because a real robot would have been pre-programmed to show a modicum of empathy.,
"Bland, subpar meat and listless employeesâ_¦the last time I was there,  got sick, nightmare alleyâ_¦not going again.", Robots deleting dumplings so we had zero idea what was contained in them as we ordered a selection for people with different preferences. Robot is the other reason we went that was fun.,
"Iâ__m Italian and We have been in this restaurant few times now and I can say for sure they serve the best Pizza in Singapore. Compliments to the Chef. The focaccia with caramelized onions is over the top :). The service is very professional and...caring.More,Dear Mr Salvatore,  Thank You for the amazing write up.
We're are committed to served all our customer with the best foods and services.

Director,1. Cosy, outdoor dining (we managed to get a table for four despite the fact that we didnâ__t make any reservation on a Saturday evening. To avoid disappointment, it is best that you make a booking in advance.)
2. Warm, attentive service by Jie Xin....My friends and I would like to compliment this service staff, Jie Xin, who is always wearing a smile and is highly professional. She puts us at ease from the time we step in till we are seated and is attentive to our requests throughout the dining duration. 
3. Delicious food (fresh ingredients) and good wine. 
4. Will return to dine again.More,Dear OLCmong,

Thank for liking our foods and most of all your server Jie Xin.
Thank You for takes time to write, its really means a lots to our teams for your kind reviews.
 Best Regards
Manager Sergio,My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal in a beautiful setting. The service was great, food delicious and excellent atmosphere. Definitely recommend!,Hi,

Our experience from foamily dinner.
We ordered:
Cannelloni di melanzane - arrived cold.
Beet salad - You expect a bit more interesting dish, and...arrived far after the other dishes, seriously..
Large pizza - Size that is no more then medium/small pizza. Pizza was good,...but why so small and charge high. So easy to make it a decent size pizza that make you feel that you value.

It's OK restaurant, but that's it. Nowadays when you go out you expect a bit more. 
If it was positioned as casual Italian with casual prices it could get 4, but this is not the case of Forketta.More,We never even made it to the table- from the moment we entered we got the â__elevatorâ__ look and since we did not arrive in our own Mercedes we were treated disrespectful! I have + 200 travel days a year so I do my fair...share of dining out. I have never tried anything so humiliating and keep in mind we are a family with a 3 year old and a 5 year old!!! We had made a reservation but there kept being issued and others had â__reservedâ__ the tables I mean I have a reservation and I believe it is in every one interest we get a more quiet table so we donâ__t â__botherâ__ any one but the untrained staff who clearly never worked in a restaurant before didnâ__t see this. Please do not even consider visiting this place itâ__s a disgrace!More,Dempsey is a lovely area for a nice evening meal.  This restaurant has really nice food and a decent wine selection.  The highlight was our server Arnel who was so friendly and provided too notch service.   A fantastic server really makes the evening special.,First and foremost, the food is why we come here. The pizza dough is really nice and chewy. I would consider their pizza to be truly authentic! Side dish: Calamari is a must have!
Service is great, although with the robotic tray holder moving around,...it does makes the ambience feel a bit... more robotic, lacking the human touch.
Thirdly, the restaurant with high ceiling has a relaxing feel to it.More,Dear Alvee ,

Thank you for your kind review. Hope to see you again soon.

LF Teams,I had booked a table for 4 for dinner. The table we got was okay. Menu is quite easy to follow and not complex. Their wine list is also quite okay, as we didnâ__t seem lost while ordering. The food we ordered was delicious and...really well made and presented. The quality of the pizza, the gnocchi gorgonzola was fabulous. The meat and cheese platters were also delicious. We had to skip dessert because we were super full with all the food & wine. We also saw delivery robots bringing food over to the table which was quite cool and a first experience for me in Singapore. The only thing that seemed to lack was service. Our waitress was okay, but not quite on the ball. She didnâ__t really know how much red wine she needs to pour in glasses and was rather impatient in clearing our dishes while we were still busy eating. This didnâ__t really spoil our evening as we really loved the food, conversations & the overall dining experience. Weâ__ll surely be back here.More,Just been for a birthday meal at Forketta, Dempsey Hill.
The food was mostly lovely, well cooked and well presented and the place itself was comfortable and well lit. The pork belly was delicious and the pasta nicely al dente. The exception was a rigatoni...ragout (pasta swapped easily to spagetti) which cloyingly coated the roof of the mouth and which was left mostly untouched.

However, the service was very inattentive and our table felt ignored even in a half-empty room. Instead of actually serving food personally,  meals arrived on a 'cat robot' - charming and fun for children but also a little sad when it was the most attentive waiter in the restaurant.

Things got worse when a cockroach ð_ª³ appeared on the table apparently from a plate delivered by cat robot.
The manager seemed fairly unconcerned about this explaining that this had never happened before and that as we're in a tropical country it's probably to be expected. Huh. (We were seated inside btw.)

Overall, the fairly lovely food was let down by the underwhelming service. Quite disappointing given the good things I'd heard about this restaurant. We will not be returning.More,Had great service from all the wait staff. Very friendly maitre d'. Food was good - pizza crust was nice, little soggy in the middle, pasta a little low on flavour and sauce, the arancini were ok but a bit too much cheese and too...much olive oil in the accompanying tomato sauce.

Had a very relaxed meal although quite expensive per dish and per drink with even appetisers $20ish - cost came to $135/head which I would have expected for a fine-dining rather than just a nice trattoria/pizzeria.More,Had a pleasant dining experience last week. 
Spoilt for choices with the wide variety of pizzas and pastas offered by the restaurant.
Food were served promptly with attentive staff.
Nice to indulge in one of their desserts too.
Good environment, great food. Will definitely come...back again.More,Pizza boscaiola really very amazing, server very friendly. Good  environment , we will come back again. Thank you hahahaha,Visited on a Thursday night. Not too busy. Really nice atmosphere. Service decent & friendly

Pizza was excellent - great base and lovely tomato sauce. Can  recommend

Pasta - I almost sent it back but service was not around and didnâ__t want to embarrass anyone....Rigatoni cooked about 3 min too long. Way too soft, zero bite. Sauce just scooped on top of the white pasta, not tossed or anything.
Feels like they just put the pasta out of the hot water and onto plate and then added a scoop full of sauce on top. 
Ragu was fine but lacked final touch.

All in all - go for the pizza but give the pasta a miss
Atmosphere is however absolutely great. 
Will go back but know what Iâ__ll orderMore,Firstly even though we booked a table way in advance, they still place us right by the toilet, on a table of 8 when there was only 3 of us. We then tried to order our meal however as we were in such an inconvenient...place no one was looking out and so no one came over to take our order!! It took us 20 mins to finally find a waitor to take our order. 

Then came the worst part, the food came before the drinks!!! We literally just ordered a coke each but the pizza came before the drinks. 

The food was tasty however the service was appaling.More,Fire wood sour dough pizza and medditerranian sald, will come back again, highly recommend this restaurant, great service with attention to details !", A delivery robot (Yes a real robot) does its best to serve you in this small restaurant.,
"Quite obviously a hit since it's like one of just a few in Australia.  Big place and amusing food robots roaming the place. That said, the food was just average, especially if you're used to eating at DTF in Taiwan or Singapore.  Take, for instance,...the signature pork cutlet fried rice. Quantity was there but the pork doesn't measure up to the usual standards in Asia. Good option if you're pining for Asian food. But not top of my list tbh.More,Good food. Frustrating service. Booked this place as fancied Chinese and special offer on the fork to coincide with Melbourne money. Tram was late so tried to call them. Got the answer machine.
Arrived about seven minutes past and stood in line for ten minutes...to be seated. Told the guy our Fork booking and not to mark us a no show. He said no problem.
Got notification about ten minutes after we sat down that we were a no show. They said they can't fix it.
Food itself is very nice and portions are good. They have these cute little robots that deliver some of the food. The only issue is that everyone's food comes at different time. Really enjoyed the spicy dumplings.
Can't complain about the food but found them beaurocratic and inflexible re my booking.. And it cost me $20 in fork credits! Therefore won't be back.More,Having eaten at Din Tai Fung in Singapore (several times) and Sydney, this experience was not up to standard. The ambience was awful. Service was non existence. No explanation that ordering was via iPad under the table. 

Food and drink came quickly once ordered. However,...the dumplings were not up th scratch. Black pepper beef and pork bun were delicious. A satisfying meal but not quite there.More,This restaurant is very popular so itâ__s best to pre-book like we did otherwise you will be on a wait list for a table.

Due to staff shortages in hospitality this restaurant uses robots to take you to your table and deliver food. A very...unique and innovative experience.

We shared meals like spicy dumplings, xiao long bao, prawn fried rice, stir fried spinach, crispy prawn baos and sizzling pepper beef. All meals were delicious.

Highly recommended restaurant.More,Wanting brunch on a Wednesday around 11.30am.....
We started off with hot & sour soup with shredded pork, followed by crispy golden prawn pancake then delicate small pork dumplings (xiao long bao) 8 pieces and Cha Jiang noodle with minced pork ....  a well rounded...choice of textures & flavours & most satisfying. 

Service was attentive & obliging. Well worth a revisit.More,loved this restaurant until they cancelled my order twice (different days) on Uber eats after almost 2 hours of waiting. Itâ__s really not good enough. Once sure - but twice. They are obviously doing something wrong that needs to be fixed. 

Terrible customer service. Such...a shame as was always a fan but wonâ__t come here again.More,I haven't been to any other Din Tai Fung, so I can't compare it to others worldwide, but as an experience by itself it delivered. 

We were able to book for a Saturday night only the day before, bonus! We were seated straight away and...used the touch screen system to order which was prompt and straight forward. 

We shared a range of vegetarian dishes and there was plenty to choose from. Just an FYI, a lot of the solid vegetarian options weren't actually under the 'vegetarian' tab on the iPad, so explore all the other categories. Finished up with a black sesame bun which was a tasty little treat. I appreciated that each dish came out when it was ready so you could order more or less depending on your hunger level. 

They have a few beers available and range of wines by the bottle or glass, most which were well priced. I believe they also offer BYO (with corkage) for both beer and wine. 

An affordable and convenient meal that I really enjoyed.More,Booked a table for two (1 hour wait list for walk-ups).
Liked the iPad order system on table.
Spicy seafood dumplings, chicken dumplings and 
General Tsoâ__s Chicken all came out quick. Very delicious.,We love Din Tai Fung! We havenâ__t been since the pandemic started and the kids were craving some Xiao long Bao. I love the spicy dumplings with dry noodle. 
We could eat this food daily! I only wish there was one in Geelong!,Dumplings originate in North China, where it gets very ccld; eating dumplings warms you up. Din Tai Fung's signature dish  is the xiao lung bao a Shanghai speciality. You hold these dumpling  over your spoon with your chopsticks, then suck out the broth. Now that...the cold weather is upon us, expect more business at Din Tai Fung. You can see the dumplings being made by hand in front of the restaurant. By the way, Din Tai Fung is in the Emporium, near Myer's city store.More,I went here twice in two weeks for xiao long bao, the famous soup dumplings.  They are immaculately hand made, and arrive piping hot.  The broth inside is sublime, rich and juicy and the filling is tasty.  You order from an iPad, and it arrives...pretty quickly, although the potstickers take a bit of time.  Great dumplings -  a new Melbourne favouriteMore,Good food, quick service. Orders to be placed with tablet. Great location, place clean and accurate.,Consistently some of the most tasty dumplings Iâ__ve ever had. Great experience, good serving speed despite being busy for Valentineâ__s Day.,I write this review with a very heavy heart. Din Tai Fung is my favorite restaurant, and I've been to about twenty locations in several countries. The Melbourne location was hands down the worst.

After being ignored for 15 minutes, we were finally able to...flag down a server to explain that the iPad at our table was broken and that we couldn't order. It took three servers to fix it, and by the time the food came, we were starving.

The xiaolongbao was below average. But what killed the experience was that there was no ginger or chili oil! They just dropped the dumplings on the table and walked away. I've never had such bad service at a DTF.

The sesame noodles were undercooked and missing green onions. The wontons in spicy sauce were underwhelming. The string beans were decent, though.

This restaurant needs a real overhaul.More,Always a top place for a relaxed dinner with high quality food and good service. The dumplings are never disappointing", I love the robot that greets you. Children may enjoy welcoming robot who accept reservation however this is not a playground but a Sushi restaurant!,
"I saw a Groupon for Happy Lamb Hot Pot for this Broadway location, so I decided to it a try with my family. I read a lot of complaints about slow service, so decided to go right at 5pm on a Saturday. At that time,...there were only a few customers, but by the time we finished right after 6pm, it started to fill up.

The soup came out shortly after we placed our order so it had time to reach boiling. And then the service robot came to deliver the dishes. Yes, a service robot! Part novelty, but it certainly had its function as it helps carry a good number of dishes all at once, so definitely more efficient than having a server make two trips. The server followed the robot, so once the robot reached us the server transferred all the plates onto our table. When we did order some supplemental dishes, the server wasn't immediately available, but the robot provided some verbal instructions to take the plates and then press the ""Done"" button, so it knew when to go back to the kitchen. Kids enjoyed interacting with the robot.

Food itself was pretty standard for hot pot. The soup base and the meats were fine. The meatballs are very tiny, but faster to cook I suppose. I didn't feel the cabbage or mushrooms were cleaned very well. There are about 10 sauces available from the self-serve counter.

As far as service was concerned, it was OK. Even though we went at 5pm to beat the crowd, there were only two servers. They were very friendly (more so than most hot pot places), but not really attentive. It took me awhile to wave a server down to order our extra plates. Considering this place has an All You Can Eat option, I could see how service speed would become a real issue when it's full and everyone is doing AYCE.

Overall, I was pretty happy with my visit. Groupon offer is a pretty good deal for decent food. Kids though the robot was cool. And we didn't suffer any major issues since I went early. I would consider coming back for the same deal.More,I have been here several times.  Reliable hot pot to get good quality food.  Great to have on a colder day.  A little beer or plum juice adds a nice finishing touch.  Street parking could be challenging depending when you come.,The experience was something we has never done.  The amount of food they served was huge.  The good guide helped a lot ,but having someone to explain everything would have made a big difference.,We really enjoy having a hot pot. It is a fun and interactive way to have a meal. The food was great. Go hungry!  Ingredients are fresh and the service is always with a smile.,Such an interesting concept to cook your own food in a pot of boiling broth at your table.  We ordered the 50/50 split of House Special Broth and the House Special Spicy Broth.   Great place to have a leisurely lunch.  Good selection of raw, thinly...sliced meats. shrimp, fish tofu, vegetables and so much more. This restaurant does not serve the extra sauces at your table, however there is a cart with all of the additional sauces that you may want to enhance your food near the bar.  The soup which becomes incredibly rich and flavourful after all of the meats, seafood and vegetables have been cooked in the gentle boiling pot is a wonderful soup and a great ending to a fun experience.    Little Sheep tends to be more expensive than Hot Pot Restaurants in the Richmond area, but still well worth the money.   I would definelty recommend and will likely return in the future.More,First of all, I did not realize this is a large chain restaurant. Only when I searched for it on TripAdvisor did I learn there are little sheep restaurants all over the place! That being said, I enjoyed my meal here. The selections were good...although I think the quality of the meat was on the lower side. The vegetables were fresh, the service was acceptable and in general it was just a fine but less than extraordinary meal. I donâ__t think they aim higher than that and I donâ__t expect more than that. However, we ended up paying about $40 per person. So, itâ__s not cheap.More,This is the most valuable hot pot place in Vancouver area (Richmond, BC, Canada).  They serve high quality fresh meats (lamb, beef, & pork), vegetable, and various mushroom at a low price of $25 for buffet.  Great services, and wonderful selection on their menu.,The broth is amazing. The rest you just need to add to the soup base and that's it. You're your own cook. Make sure you cook the food well though, as you can get sick.
I'd recommend anyone coming here.,This was our first experience with a hot pot. Our server was patient, and explained how to order, and how to cook the raw ingredients. There are 5 different sauces. Complimentary hot tea. The food comes more quickly than you would expect, great service! The...sliced mutton shoulder was a flavor explosion... and the taro is worth a try.More,Well a lot of things are done superb here!! But the service was awful.... this place is busy most times.
We were (family table of 4) curious about trying out a hot pot restaurant, with my son living near, we choose the little sheep on...Broadway.
With no previous hot pot experience I would have liked an introduction, would have loved to know that I have to get the dipping sauces myself from the front, the tea service was non-existent had to ask for.
No water was offered, no one came by and ask how we are enjoying the food, the quality of the food and broth was good. I felt the service really let us down tonight, even so the restaurant looked efficient and well staffed.More,My husband and I were very hungry, so we had the â__Little Sheep Deluxe Combo for Twoâ__. What a fantastic array of food along with different dipping sauces. We selected the 1/2 and 1/2 broth. One side was very spicy for my husband and the...other side nice and savory for me.

The service was excellent and incredibly accommodating. Thank you Jimmy!

We literally â__rolledâ__ out of there, completely and happily satiated. Great value for the amount of food you get!More,I am not one to judge a restaurant based on first impressions but I have been here twice and was left disappointed both times.... in the first trip I thought the value for hot pot +service was not justified cause my friends and I were...cramped in a corner and the wait staff was only paying attention to dinners from the same ethnicity.... but I let that slide thinking â__itâ__s dinner time and I understand they must be busyâ__. We ended up paying for the hot pot experience and leaving in an mediocre mood. 

The second time, however, we went during lunch (hardly 5 booths were occupied) and had to wait 10 minutes before we could be seated. Our waitress was completely MIA so we had to keep searching for her just to flag someone down for a refill on our drinks or to order more items of the buffet menu. This time though we already werenâ__t expecting an exceptional service but, what really dampened our moods was when the lady at the cash register ASKED us to tip her. 

I usually tip more than necessary but to be told to tip is such an insult as a customer who is using the establishment. Needless to say I will never be returning to this restaurant and will advice my friends not to come as well.More,It was our first time at this location.  We had one of their vouchers and there was plenty of good food to consume.  The food and service is consistently good across all their locations.  Street parking is available.  Reservations best.,The food was fresh and the soup base was delicious.  The spicy soup gets hotter as your meal progresses.  Reasonable price for what it is. Staff could be friendlier.,Groupon offers AYCE $39.00 for 2 persons including soup base (claiming 42% off).  Not such a bad deal.  Staff were pleasant and there was no arguments in terms of how much you order.  We found that parking was a challenge especially during the rush hour.", The main attraction here is the Robot serving the food for you.,
"Touch Restaurant in Bakirkoy by the Atakoy Towers is restaurant of the future. The fast food restaurant has robots serving food to your table, but it's not just that. First you can order food on the table which is a fascinating duo of table and...touch screen. This takes touch screen ordering to a different level. Once you order the food, the table screen turns into live TV and the food you ordered is shown on the table while being cooked live. Once the order is ready, Robots serve the food directly to your table. It's not the only Robot restaurant in the world but it's uniquely executed.

It's not just the Robot and Touch screen tables concept which make this place great. The food is perfect too. Mainly it's a fast food serving Burgers and Pizzas. We ordered their Special Burger and it was really perfect. Juicy meat with freshness. The people in the kitchen are certainly not robots and great cooks. This is a place with style and substance both.

Being a relatively new concept, the restaurant does have serving staff for people who get confused by touch screen ordering. The staff is friendly and try their best to help. The pricing is very reasonable and nothing is pricey at all.

If you are motivated enough to try this tech-fueled great fast food restaurant, it's easily accessible by Metro at a walking distance from Yenibosna Station. Don't miss it.More","They have some kind of robot that brings your food to your table, but a human will serve it to you. Check out the robot waiter!",
Drive thru got home 2 minutes later food ice cold fries half empty.  I ate the fries and my gr ate 1 cheeseburger we didnt want the hassle.  My big mac ice cold her 2 sandwiches ice cold brought it back no refund.  Called back...later to plead my case again was told EJ was in the bathroom. Jeez look at reviews seems like contempt for thier customers.  I have terminal cancer this trip was a treat I allow myself this restaurant is poorly run and obviously letting food sit so long its ice cold. Train your peopleMore,Weird robot server. We also liked the robot waiter.,
"Now that I got your attention fellow Foodies I happened to meet Alex and Andrew from @thepizzaforno who were checking up on their latest Automated Pizza Making Box in East Markham !! Located at the Petro Canada at 16th Ave and 9th Line. They were...kind enough to walk me through how it worked and offered me a complimentary pizza !! I chose the MeatLovers pizza and got it cold so I could enjoy it later with the kids !! You can order pizza through the @thepizzaforno app or right at the Pizza Box, or through the app!! It takes most types of standard payments and only takes 3-4 minutes to make and you can order ahead of time or make it at home - My pizza took only 4 minutes to cook. Pros - Open 24 hours, and many selections, ready in a few minutes and fresh ingredients!! Cons - I only got to try one lol !! Give Pizza Forno a try and in this day and age of Covid-19, itâ__s a great alternative!! The pizza itself was amazing and Kid-Approved !!!More", A Robot ???? brings them to you it's fantastic.,
"You can easily make a reservation online to avoid disapointment. The waiters are friendly but didn't explain much. I took the mildest of the 3 spice levels which was still quite hot. Putting the meat and veggies in the pot was quite a mess since...I only had chopsticks and a soupspoon. When leaving I noticed other tables having clippers and a basket. There is a robot, who's supercute. It Brings the ingredients to the table. I enjoyed my food, it was delicious and enough variation. The place has a great vibe. It's clean and well taken Care of.More,I LOVE. THIS. PLACE. it took me so long to find a good hot pot place in Barna and i finally found it after a year. Definitely coming back regularly,As a Chinese living overseas, I am so excited to find this hotpot place while traveling to Valencia with my family. Children love it and my husband too! We stay in Valencia for 2 weeks and this is the second time we came (on the...request of my husband and kids). Everything is fresh and the taste is authentic! 
If there is one small thing to improve, I am
not sure if it is a good way to tell every guest that you have 1.5 hour to eat here. I understand there will be reservations afterwards and the table needs to turn over. But there might be better ways to explain. Especially today there was a table of 11 people, and other tables had to wait for a long long time to get served. Impossible to finish within 1.5 hours. Though in fact, they wonâ__t chase you out if you stay longer.More,A super delicious dinner together with my lovely family.
I'm frankly happy with the food at this place.,A very nice place and deliciuos food. The perfect place to share with your friends and family. I really really really love. I recomend you to do a reservation begore cause the place is almost full.,We loved the food and the people behind it pf course we will come again, we celebrated a birthdayð_¥°ð_¥°,As expat lived in China, so we are familiar with Hotpot. And itâ__s similar and absolutely great! The robot is completing it!,The food was great, amazing stuff, very recommending the place.
The hot soup is very spicy be careful but very good food.,We had a great experience! The robot waiter was fun, but above all: this is a classic hot pot restaurant in which you can enjoy a typical Chinese hot pot,We came as a group of eight people from various parts of the world. Luckily, one of us was a Chinese native, who explained how â__hot potâ__ works. It was delicious Szechuan food - the spiciest cuisine of China. Very delicious food and excellent service.,Really enjoyed our meal. Several options for stock to cook meat, seafood and vegetables. The spicy one was splendid and the mildest version was still very hot. Lots of dips and extras to spice it up even more. Will definitely go back.,I was there with my bf and another couple and we had an amazing time. The atmosphere is very nice and the restaurant itself is very clean and has an inviting look. The food was simply amazing. I love spicy (medium spicy was already very...very spicy) and to me the food was as authentic as in China. That's why I liked it so much. Reminded me of when I was living in Beijing.More,Super good! Everything was super amazing, my favorite hot pot place now !!!!! The fried tofu and everything was just wow,Great service and very cool feeling in the place. Felt very young!! The food was amazing and the price also amazing for the experience we got. We will be back for more,The place was really clean, the staff was friendly and helpful and the food delicious! We went with a standard combo of meats and seafood, it ended up being too much food, so we will order a la carte next time.","The highlight of the day was the robot waiter, a multi-shelved machine which ferries food to the tables, which delighted my 3 year old grandson.",
"Best place for beer lovers. The staff is very friendly and the chicken dishes here are excellent. Highly recommended,The placed is located on a small lane were on One side is full of eateries. The food and service is good. The Beer was great. 
Plz book in advance and go.
This lane is located in a residential area thus is a Noise Free...area. The place can get very noisy.More,Have a small selection of good beers, although a little on the expensive side as is their food.
Service always good.
Great place to chill with friends.,Have been there on multiple occasions (aft birthday party/evening get togethers) and each visit has been worth a good memory.

They have good beer (personally like wheat beer) though friends love black one. Red wine Sangria is nice as well while white wine sangria is...like a sugar syrup!!

They have board games ensuring everyone across age groups gets engrossed.

One big negative is the music which is stopped by 12 midnight, in the outdoor seating area.More,Brewbot is a nice place to hangout with friends or colleagues. The place has a lovely ambience and quality finger food. The place offers its own brews apart from the regular branded stuff.

Botwork Orange, their Belgian wit is the way to go if you...like a light citrusy and mildly spicy wheat beer. This one also happens to be our favourite. Floating Head, their hefeweizen beer is also pretty good.

Finger food served at Brewbot is also pretty good. The tacos were great. The guacamole with house made nachos was good too. The peri peri fries are extra hot and crisp.

Do try their juicy burgers...

Great experience.More,Was looking forward to visit this place - as found it to be the only in house brewery in mumbai, yes rest all have craft beers on tap but they donâ__t brew at the restaurant. Low on decor, small brewery. Has outdoor seating option too....Waiters are slow, donâ__t understand things and donâ__t deliver on time. Beers were below average. IPA was still better compared to wheat and stout. Stout was a total waste. Food wasnâ__t good either. Ordered 1 dishes and was delivered only 1. The waiter refused accepting the order, strange experience and total let down. Wound t recommend for beers.More,We tried a few beers, some were good and the rest average. The ambience was good. the food was pretty bad- we ordered the calamari and it was chewy and not fun to eat.,Value for money.food is good the choice is ok but not much.on weekends you Must book a table.ambience is ok.,Good Beer and Good Food.

Botwork Orange, their Belgian wit is the way to go if you like a light citrusy and mildly spicy wheat beer. This one also happens to be my favourite. Floating Head, their hefeweizen beer is also pretty good. With Zomato...Gold 2+2, its a sweet deal.

Finger food served at Brewbot is also pretty good. The tacos were great. The guacamole with house made nachos was good too. The peri peri fries are extra hot and crisp. Do try their juicy burgers, forgetting the name though.More,Brewbot has a nice ambience going for them, they have a small outdoor seating as well. They have a good selection of beers on tap, i personally like their wheat beer. Good finger food which goes well with the beer.,Located in the lane full of restaurants, it brewery is the main pull factor for beer lovers (Though I am more of a Old Monk person ð___). The food is something which has never disappointed me. The French Fries options are just tasty and filling....Hangover fries is the one which is there in image. The portion of each dish, it's damn good for two people. The burger which we tried was also tasty. And last but not the least, the manager of the place has been very helpful whenever I have visited the place. Three cheers to him and his team. One have not given 5 star as sometimes I don't like the music.More,Had been here with my cousins to enjoy some drinks on saturday night.However, were bit disappointed with the service and options of Craft Beers available.  There are around 8-10 options to choose the variances but few of them weren't available.  In the limited choices, we...had called for Honey Basel speciality which was just Ok in taste.  Food order took good time to be serverd and tasted average. The prices of the other drinks are also bit on a higher side. Overall, it wasn't a great experience compares to the price we paid for food and drinks.

PS: You should allow guest to taste the house special @ the table than going at the bar counter!More,It was my1st visit to this happening place in Andheri, Mumbai besides famous Punjab Grill. Great blending of freshly brewed beer will quench your thirst. Additionally the menu is quite spread with sumptuous items..,Me & the wifey decided to head All the way to Andheri to sample Brewbot's famous craft beers. It was a Saturday night but we managed to get a table after hanging at the bar and trying out their sample of beers which were all...quite good but one that stood out for both of us...the Black Mamba. The coffee & chocolate infused flavour had us hooked. If only they would open somewhere closer, I'd be a regular visitor.More,HIGHLIGHTS- 

All their Finely Crafted Beers ð__º

Apple cider 

Black Mamba were my favourites.

ð__´Blue cheese tenderloin sliders 

ð__µTony Montana Disco fries.

ð___ LOCATION- It's Veera Desai Area which is at walkable distance from DN Nagar metro station.
 

ð___ AMBIANCE- Beautiful lights and the big...bar station with Robot images as backdrop with some huge beer tanks. Cozy Seating arrangements. Feels like an Irish bar because of it's rustic vibe. Outside seating available.

ð___ SERVICE- Staff is humble and knows their work. Quick service. The Brewery tour guided by Mr. Vaibhav was knowledgeable.

ð___ BEERS - ð__» Crafted Beers from Brewbot are considered as best in Mumbai. They do not use any synthetic material in production of their beers. Matching the beers originating from USA and Germany for the Indian beer lovers would have been a challenging task but they've certainly succeeded in that. 

ð__»OutCider - ð__«ð__· From France with love the Apple cider has sweetness of apple with dry finish. Fresh aroma of Himalayan apples. One of my personal favourite from all the beers I tried.

ð__»Skywalker- ð__©ð__ª with the German origin this beer is smooth on the palate. Fruitiness is brought out by fermentation.

ð__»Draft punk- ð__ºð__² Style- Pale ale India has a complex malt profile with moderate bitterness. Grapefruit and citrus notes on the palate.

ð__»Floating Head- ð__©ð__ª German origin beer with wheat malt profile with moderate banana fruitiness with bubble gum and close accents.

ð__»Black mamba- ð__¬ð__§ British Origin Mamba is one of my favourites. Oat flavour accented by Chocolate and raisins followed by coffee is like the best combination.

ð__»Botwork orange- ð__§ð__ª Belgium being the origin here this beer has prominent coriander hint. There is a slight zesty Orange fruitiness on the palate.

ð__»Mystery pale ale - ð__ºð__² This Pale ale from USA has hop bitterness with caramel to balance it with tropical citrus touch.

ð___ APPETIZERS-

ð__®

ð__µCrispy avocado tacos- lemon and sriracha aioli together with coleslaw and pickled onion tasted garden- fresh.

ð__´Chicken tinga- This time coleslaw with pickled onion and sour cream. Brilliant. A must try.

ð__´Crispy fish tacos- Spicy yet tangy salsa with guacamole with Jalape_±os topped with sour cream garnished with fresh cilantro was drool worthy.

ð__´Goan Chorizo Potato Skins- Sriracha aioli was disappointing a bit because there was no spicy flavour in it.

ð__´Peri peri chicken sliders- So tender and juicy chicken with little microgreens. Purple cabbage slaw added an extra cherry to the dish. A must have.

ð__´Blue cheese tenderloin sliders- Beautiful Monterey Jack cheddar with barbecue sauce caramelized onion jam with crispy elements like microgreens and onion rings made this dish the hero of the evening. â­_ Loved it the most.

ð__µ1/2 dozen pita falafel slider- Harissa hummus was disappointing. The tabolueh, lemon aioli and paprika chillies somehow balanced the whole dish. Presentation was great.

ð__µTony Montana disco fries - Spicy piri piri fries topped with beer cheese sauce, sauteed onions and delicious aioli with Jalape_±os made this dish one heck of a comfort food Craving . Delicious. Goes well with almost all the beers.

ð___

ð__µSriracha Cottage Cheese pizza- ð___ Thin crusted, cheesy pizza with tender spicy cottage cheese was wonderful. Yes a must have.

ð__´Chipotle chicken pizza- Slightly disappointing to my taste buds. If given an option I would go with cottage cheese pizza over this anytime.

ð___ DESSERTS- Both willy Wonka and Icecream sundae were yummy.

â­_Alert for all the Beer lovers out there. 

This place is highly recommend!!!â­_More", They introduced a robot service where a robot comes to serve you food.,
"Really disappointed tonight to go to the restaurant and find they had a 10% surcharge on a Sunday!  I understand a  10% on a Public Holiday but on a Sunday?  Also a 1% surcharge for credit AND debit card. Sorry Spice Market we wonâ__t be...back.More,Today we went to the recently opened SPICE MARKET at Karrinyup Shopping centre.
That was our first mistake...
Our second was to order their Chicken Satay Skewers followed by a Laksa with Chicken Breast.
Both dishes tasted like the same boiled pieces of chicken were...used from what we can only assume was a pile of pre-cooked chicken in the kitchen.
The best Satay is made by marinating the raw chicken in a special marinade overnight. This marinade is the most important part of the recipe and includes lots of spices and ingredients, such as the following: Lemongrass/Garlic/Shallots/
Turmeric powder/Coriander powder/Chili powder/Salt and sugar
The next step is to pound all the ingredients above with a mortar and pestle until it becomes a fine paste. Only then do you add the raw meat to ensure that every skewer is bursting with robust flavors. When ordered, the skewers are grill over an open flame for 2-3 minutes on each side until the meat is fully cooked and the surface is nicely charred, on both sides.
The final result is served with a peanut sauce either smothered over the top or in a separate ramikin.
Spice Markets version was strips of plain, unmarinated, boiled chicken with a rather bland peanut sauce on top. Much quicker and a lot easier to make, but dull, colourless and boring!
Our third mistake was to order a LAKSA...Surely, even a Thai themed restaurant knows how to make a fairly authentic Malaysian Laksa...?
Not this one - NO!
The same bland lifeless strips of white boiled chicken were added to an anemic looking white broth that tasted only of stock and coconut. Even the addition of a red chili paste could not breathe life into this asian classic staple.
My wife ordered the Tom Yum Goon which to it's credit had a number of good sized prawns in a passable broth with loads of mushrooms.
Would we try the 'SPICE' Market again? NO WAY!!!
There are far too many restaurants of asian origin that cook asian food properly and don't take so many unpleasant shortcuts.More,We had a young boy to our table and could not understand a thing we said. We were nice and tried but this kid had no knowledge of English at all. How is he allowed to work on a visa when we know to get...that work visa he has to know understand and speak English. This needs to be reported. The food was 5/10 at best. Shocking and will never go backMore,Absolutely beautiful food. Robots are great ð___ love how you can order via the app. We had money bage,dumplings,satay sticks,more dumplings ! Highly recommend,Walked in on Sunday night with the family and stood at the register for about 7-8 mins and was completely ignored by at least 4 staff. No-one acknowledged us, even attempted to serve, or even said - won't be a minute.

Pathetic.

They should get...more robots and sack the humans.

Walked out, never againMore,Wagyu beef cooked to perfection 
Sweet chilli and sour in perfect blend in the beef salad
Soft shell crab bao is delicious 
Chilli jam noodles filling and flavoursome 
Tropical thunder mocktail is mango in a glass, amazing
Washed down with a pino  colada it's a...real taste of authentic Thai food
And delivered by an adorable robotMore,Hi all
Walked in on an early sunday evening.  Place was packed.  Pleasant efficent staff and a robot!  We ordered two starters and two mains which was a bit too much for us!  The food was fresh and tasty and a definite step up from...the usual Thai place.  We thought the value for money was very good.  Would go back.More,Great selection on menu, good quality of offerings, we found this restaurant to be of a good standard
After eating small amounts of fish and huge amounts of chips at exorbitant pricing for being close to the water this restaurant offered something quite refreshing.,Excellent food! We loved the robot waiter and ordering online was easy. The Thai pork salad was huge and delicious.  Highly recommend this restaurant.,Didnâ__t know what to expect from the small front entry. Was not disappointed! Lots of room inside. Great menu to choose from were your can have a base noodle/ rice/salad/etc and choose your meat. Service was quick and it was a robot! Yep a robot...brings out your meals. Food was delicious/healthy /fresh and full of flavor   Great choice of cocktails etc. will definitely be back.More,The meals are really well presented, they look good, enticing.The decor and ambience is nice .The service is pretty good for a busy restaurant BUT This restaurant is not Thai .The main ingredient in every meal is sugar . There is precious little chilli or...other spices..so the name is a falsehood . I spend a lot of time in Thailand,this food is some sort of fusion , Australians have sugar in their fast food so give them the same ?
   If you know nothing about Thai food and want a change from Hungry Jacks OK.. but it is not a Thai dining experience at allMore,Wow what a treat. My salad was delicious . Papaya Salad with BBQ pork $21.90. Fresh and so tasty. My partner had Kuy teaw lord noodles. Steamed flat rice noodels shitike, dried shrimp, chicken mince, prawns, peas, carrot, spring onion, tofu & bean sprouts with...home made soya sauce. That also was delicious. $17.90. Service was good and place was very clean.More,Wednesday night booking. Was quite busy.  Food was amazing- great presentation & taste. Big selection on menu. Took half hour for our first drink to arrive.  Second drink came after we had finished our meal. Looked like only 1 girl preparing drinks.,Very noisy or vibrant. Fully booked or busy. High tech or impossible for the non-smart phone users. Love the novelty. Run by maybe a hunch of entrepreneurial youngsters. Chives dumplings were ok. Tom yum was ok. Stir fry veg was a tad undercooked but I...donâ__t mind a solid piece of broccoli.  Will hope to try Steamer barramundi next time!More,We went here as a family for dinner. The waitress explained how to order through our phone, so clever and so convenient. Food came out on the robot which we all loved. We had the chicken boa, amazing. The pad Thai, satay stirfry and the...masaman beef. Everything was so delicious and I feel really well priced. Great addition to freo!More", I then got onto the help robot again whilst in the restaurant.,
"If you are a sushi fan, this is a good place to try. The restaurant has the take-yourself sushi belt and robot server. So everything can be done self service from your table, including online food or drink ordering through touch screen tablet. The sushi...variety is great and they are delicious. Price is reasonable although you tend to spend more because of the small serving of each plate. The restaurant ambiance is inviting.More,We took the kids to this newer revolving/conveyor belt sushi place as it has robots and games.  When you order your drinks, a robot brings them to you beeping as it arrives.  You then can pull the plates of what you want off the conveyor...belt (lower belt) or, if you want something not on the line, you can order dishes and they show up zoomed to your table on the upper conveyor belt.  Each time you eat 15 plates worth of food, you get an anime/manga prize, which worked on our kids wanting to try more.  There are also animations when you deposit a certain number of plates into the counter.  Not inexpensive, but the sushi quality was good for a conveyor belt place.  I would be happy to come back, but there can be a long wait to get in.More", The wait-staff here remind one of robots programmed with huge smiles and a list of hyperbolic adjectives dispensed as if being read from a teleprompter.,
"Decor very modern and stylish relaxed atmosphere.  Food was fantastic this would be a lot more expensive in a city in the UK.  Service was excellent. Robot we love â_¤ u,A lovely dining experience. This restaurant is beautifully decorated. The menu is extensive and presented as a book. You can choose to dine in 2 ways; either by ordering 4 plates, dessert and coffee for a set price, or order as many dishes as you...want, excluding dessert and drinks for a slightly higher price. We chose the latter and were not disappointed. We wrote our order down and it was delivered by robot. The food was tasty, some of the portions were tiny, but you can order as many portions as you want to. We spent 3, unhurried hours there, and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.More,Had a great night good food ...a little unusual...food is ordered on a little notebook and is delivered by robot ...great fun ..try it,The staff was excellent & attention to detail was superb & food was outstandingâ_¦. Lots of variety of flavours on the menu & the robot ð_¤_ bringing the food to the table was a fantastic touch",None,
"Everyone loves the concept of outer space, and this new restaurant takes that experience just a little bit further. If you have children or, like us are simply  big kids you will love this place.
Imagine you are in the 24th century, dining out means...your food is delivered by robot. Here the aim is not to remove people, as I suspect the waiters here do a lot more running around than you would expect .On arrival you receive the briefing from a waiter, how to order and pay on the iPad. What to do when your meal arrives via robo-buggy and then you're on your own. The menu is substantial and the food is good but who cares when it is delivered by robot eh? Most food and drink arrive at high speed by robo-buggy on aerial  rails, spiralling down out of the sky, and for those dishes that are too fragile for such treatment, they arrive by regular robot. Tasty, fun and very different, thoroughly enjoyed it.More","You put money into a slot and this ""robot"" preparers a soft serve cone (with very good ice cream) for you.",

great experience, woulb be great to have robot kuka at home. very nice waitress that you can never argue with! :),There was 4 of us that came here and it is very good, loved the idea of the robot pouring a glass of wine and the whole idea of it being delivered to your table. Was not keen on the beer or food though which...was disappointing. It is worth a visit but wonâ__t return.More,Great experience. Come and be served by a robotic hand with delicious wine from southern Moravia called Dog in Dock. And wait you see the food.. :-D,What an incredible experience for technology geeks.  This is a wine bar that is really superb.  An absolute must if you want to see a robot serve up your wine and have it delivered to your table..", It?_?s robot at work.,
"We were so pleasently surprised by Pepper Parlor! Unlike many other themed cafes, the waffles at Pepper Parlor are actually tasty and the experience is so much fun! You order through a robot (who speaks English and Japanese!) and, if you're lucky, you can sit...at one of the few tables that has a robot friend. Unfortunately, those ones only speak Japanese, but we still loved eating with a robot. Hopefully, these guys will also be able to interact in English soon. Yes, it's pricey, but if you're considering a visit, it's definitely worth it!More,ã__ã__ã__ã_¼ã__ã__ã_®ã_«ã__ã_§ã__ã_¤ã__ã_«ã_§ã__ã_¾ã__ã__ï¼_ï¼_æ¸_è°·é§_ã__ã__ã__ã__ã_®æ_±æ_¥ã__ã_©ã_¶ã_«ã__ã__ã_¾ã__ã__

A great experience ????????????,I had drinks with my family to have a break",
"I don't have Amici's often because there isn't a location near us. I decided to have it delivered thru DoorDash since everything is takeout only currently. The pizza was as good as previously although not very warm. We had heirloom tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach. It...was yummy. Although I enjoy the thin crust, it's not as filling.More,I ordered the small spaghetti with clam red sauce.  It was a large portion of pasta and a roll.  I added a half order of garlic bread which was a good sized piece.  Tasted great.  Of course, everything is take out or delivery now.  The...staff were very nice.  Quick preparation.  There is seating located outside on the sidewalk.More,I was here for an after work event. Flavorful and tasty pizza! Phenomenal staff, very helpful, attentive, and friendly. Parking was pretty good!,Good food and appropriate for families.   This crust pizza is good and the childrenâ__s menu has lots of choices.   My favorite is the Cesar salad dressing that I actually guy by the pint and take home!   My 11 year old granddaughter loves their pene with...pesto sauce.  Something for everyone here!More,Place was empty around 3pm. Service was great. Food delicious. I had baked ziti with eggplant...cleaned the plate.,I ordered a 10-inch specialty/adopted thin crust pizza â__sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, tomatoes, and onions for $19.75 +tax + tip (October 2019). It was excellent. 

Be careful about ordering special ingredients. I was confused and had to ask the waiter for price information. If I had...not asked, they would have charged me $5 more!

The waiter was attentive, helpful and excellent. 

D_©cor is attractive inside. Plus they offer plenty of pleasant outdoor seating for the warm days. 

Parking at noon was easy, free, and street level. However, downtown Mountain View is popular and parking can be difficult at times. 

Two deals Amiciâ__s currently have are attractive and I want to try:: Monday they offer 20% off all day on your food and beverage. On Wednesday they offer half-price on all pastas! This is October 2019; you may want to call to see if these discounts apply in the future.More,Try the Panzanella salad - it was excellent  - as was the pesto pasta and ravioli. It's a cute setting with very nice outdoor seating.  The service was good - the waiter knew the menu and was happy to recommend.  On Castro street in Mountain...View.More,Brought the grandkids here last night.   They have kids menus with games on the back which kept my 7 year old grandson happy.  He had the pasta shells with butter for $3.95.  My granddaughter had the mini pizza for $10.  I had the large order...of penne with pesto.   The pesto was not as good as Iâ__ve had here and the order was not large and it was $18.  My husband had the spaghetti with Italian sausage.  His order was huge!  He got sausage as a side order.....it was burned so he had it replaced.    Itâ__s a good place for familiesMore,Brought the grands here for dinner.  Little one (7) likes their pasta shells with butter and cheese on the kids menu.   Bigger one eats a large order of pasta with pesto sauce.   I got a mini cheese pizza.  My hubby got linguini with marinara sauce...and hot sausage.   All was good.   A new addition to my he place....robots helping the server.   He took the order and the robot brought the drinks.   I asked for rolls and the robot brought them.  Hope the robot doesnâ__t replace the waiter all together.  Kids (as well as adults) were enjoying watching the robot deliver!More,I ordered online, the Baked Penne Pasta with Eggplant and bread.  I was a few minutes late due to traffic, but no worries, they had my order in a warming bin.  The food was really delicious and was packaged well for take-out.  Reasonably priced and...good service at the take-out counter.  I would definitely order from them again.More,Lately the quality has deteriorated, pizza is too thin and often burned and very salty. More expensive than Papa John and Domino.,My Hubble and I took our granddaughter here to celebrate her making a sports team.  We all ordered something different and made it a true shared family dinner.  On our table was pasta with pesto, a small cheese pizza, spaghetti with marinara sauce, Italian sausage...side and an overindulgent side of chicken wings.  All was really good.  My granddaughter loves their pesto sauce.   Rolls on the table are so delicious.  We brought home enough food for lunch tomorrow!  Excellent service too!More,Came here with my 11year old granddaughter and 6 year old grandson.She loves Cesar salad and basil on her pasta.  We split the salad and she got a full order of penne and shared a bit with me.  I got the children's mini pizza and...shared with her.   My little guy was happy with the $3.00 pasta shells with butter and cheese.  Amicus has the best Cesar salad dressing in the world and sometimes, when I'm entertaining, I will buy just the dressing to take home.  On this dinner stop, we were all quite happy!More,I had the Fettuccine Alfredo, pesto,and  chicken Caesar salad.I had room service while working at the Palo Alto Clinc.This beautiful Blonde delivered my Italian food looking like she came from an audition from the American Pie.My First Amici""s East Coast Experience was worth the extra...bucks.â__Sei come il prezzemolo.â__
Here something for my sweet hearts.
Tonight there's a crowd in my head:
all the things you are not yet.
You are words without paper, pages
sighing in summer forests, gardens
where builders stub out their rubble 
and plastic oozes its sweat.
All the things you are, you are not yet.-AnthonyMore,Thin crust pizza, consistently good! The lunch service staff is exceptional. Our waitress always brings me extra anchovies to add to my Caesar salad (and my pizza). The restaurant gets a bit noisy during the lunch rush but so does every other place along Castro....The outside seating on a beautiful day is top notch. Recommend the Tonno Pizza (tuna, capers, greens) for something unique as well as the classics (pepperoni, cheese, Amici Combo, etc.).More",I somewhat appreciate the extra effort to 'confirm' my order is correct...but...they interact like robots vs paying attention to the REALITY of my order.,
"It was OK at the very best. Food was quite greasy but tasty. Not good by a long shot. Wonâ__t come back. Was not a terrible experience but there are so many better places in Prague,Had dinner with colleagues. Menu good, service perfect - even the robot. 
WIll come here again next trip,We found this restaurant two months ago and was there numerous times. We bring our friends, too. All was very satisfied with food and service. Also, the restaurant is very clean and interior is nice. This is my favorite restaurant these days. We always ordered...from daily menu (in Czech) and portion are very big and not expensive. I prefer Duck in Teriyaki sauce. My best recommendations!!!More,Was with a big group and got our food quickly. The menu had a lot of options, even for the vegeterians. Evertthing was really good for the price,The place is located in the left corner across from the Palladium main entrance.

It is a good choice for dinner especially if You want to take a break from fat and heavy Czech meals.
Macao & Wok is focused on the nice atmosphere, simple...serving and the great variety of dishes, especially soups: vegetable soups, fish soups and noodle soups of course.
Don't miss the opportunity to try steam meals such as dim sum, wontons or rice with vegetables. The are all marvellous.More,We tried this one because we had near to our flat and it was a really good surprise.
As soon as you get into you can see it's a good one, so the decoration and tables are really well.
The big surprise is when they...gave me the menu to have a choice so it was a book not a menu, it was a huge menu with many many options. I was unable to decide something reading all the options so we decided to order the standard menu for 4 people. After including the drinks, coffees and tip we paid less than 20 euros each.
The staff and service could be better but the food, quality and price was amazing.More,Ordered the bibimbap and ramen and was disappointed. The service was ok, but high price for mediocre food.,Pleasant place and nice service. Portions are really big and not expensive. Noodles were really great.,We ate here twice on vacation. The food was delicious. Atmosphere was pleasant. The service was mediocre at best but worth the visit for good Chinese food. The location was an easy walk from our hotel and felt very safe. I would recommend Macao and...would go back again.More,Fancied something different to the local food and spotted this place tucked in the corner along the road good chines food loved it and wife had the banana slit to follow,I would evaluate this place as a place full of contrasts. I think that there are many aspects why people could both love it or hate it.

To start off, I would like to mention that the food was delicious and they had extraordinary wide...scale of great meals. We had 3 appetizers and they were all great. Our main meal was from the daily menu and I donâ__t believe that there is anything that we did not like about it.

The real struggle was the personnel. The ladies, who were taking care of us did not seem to speak english NOR CZECH(This is very weird for a place right in the centre of Prague). There were couple more issues with serving the food. First we recieved 2 appetizers and then it was only my boyfriend, who got the main meal. I had to wait for another 10 minutes and even then the lady gave us just the last appetizer and then finally I got to eat my food. I feel that there was lack of continuity and profesionality. Later when we were ready for payment, we had to wait another 15 minutes, even though there were no other customers and the personnel did not seem to be bothered by this fact(they were looking at their phones, fixing their hair, or just sitting). 

Overall, I would say that if you are very hungry and you are craving chinese food, it is a perfect fit for you(the portions are huge and delicious), however if you are a busy person, I donâ__t recommend this place. Also it is not fit for professional meetings or anything related. You wonâ__t get the profesionality that you are looking for.More,This is situated very conveniently next to the Palladium shopping centre. Food is excellent and authentic, restaurant is also clean and pleasantly decorated. If the owner should read this review, please please please train the two local waitresses to give better service. They were supercilious...and hostile. If you feel serving is beneath you then work elsewhere, they were more interested with their mobile phones. The Chinese staff were helpful. A real pity because the food is tasty.More,The ambient lighting in the venue was not up to my specifications. There was a creepy robot serving the plates and food which was terrifying. The service was slow and frankly shocking and very very laidback. We ordered 10 portions of Macao chicken and got...23 portions all were tasteless, frankly the robot wouldnâ__t take no for an answer. The salmon fillet was as dry as gandhis flip flop so would avoid. Iâ__m sure the server was dripping like a knackered fridge which was respectable. All in all wouldnâ__t take my worst enemy here was bloody rotton.More,A little higher level of Chinese restaurant. Not the typical fast bistro. Serving a pretty wide selection of Chinese dishes. Good location (right next to the Shopping center Palladium) and friendly staff, although they dont speak Czech very well. A lot pf fun watching a...little electronic busboy cleaning up.More,Im very satisfied with this reastaurant.. fast and very good food. It was 200 near underground station.","Obviously not interested in customers, just a robot service. And YES we were able to use the touch screens this time BUT nothing quite beats interaction with friendly people who are cooking your incredible burger....unless they were really realistic robots",
"This hamburger shop located in Kabukicho.
The hamburger in this shop was the best I ate in Japan.
Especially the meat is amazing!
I want to come again.,A triple cheeseburger shop in Shinjuku that uses 100% Japanese beef.
The coarsely ground putty was thick, juicy, and had a good compatibility with cheese.
It is recommended because it is a burger shop that is open late at night.,Thank you for visiting us.
Next try another hamburger!,Shogun Burger is right opposite the Robot Restaurant so conveniently located. Itâ__s small and seats no more the 15 people snuggly into its narrow place. At 1200Yen or $15 Australian itâ__s only the pricey side. But the taste is worth it. 
Size is exactly how...a burger should be but these ones have original made made meat - no prepackaged stuff here. Flavours our fabulous and I mean really fabulous. 
Although I ordered a cheeseburger it was still a good size but did see other meals come out that were quite spectacular in presentations. 
You order at the front of the shop where there is a computer screen but donâ__t worry, a staff member will help you if youâ__re unsure. Basically though itâ__s quite intuitive and youâ__ll have no issue. There are printed menus as well. You can pay by cash or card. 
Staff were lovely. It took a little while to receive my order but the place was busy and it was well worth the wait. 
After youâ__re finished, you place your dishes at the rear on a rack where you dispose of everything. 
All round a good experience. 
Wheelchair friendly for the front of the restaurant. Kids will love this place and are welcome.More,Thank you for visiting us.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

When you come to the robot restaurant, we are waiting for you again!,My wife and I both had cheese burgers, single and double respectively. I'm a less is more kinda guy when it comes to burgers and believe the beauty lies in the simplicity, and when the patties are this good you don't need much else. These...are juicy and flavorful patties grilled to perfection, on a great bun, accompanied by crispy fries. The white tiger pale ale was really good too.More,I donâ__t know if it was that I was in Japan and didnâ__t know what I was eating half the time, but the Shogun burger tasted too good to this English (only) reading, American food deprived American woman! I suspect it was also the difference...of the wagyu beef used to make my delish burger that made it one of the best Iâ__ve ever had. Their fries are yum too!More,I love visiting Japan because, in general, food here is better than just about anywhere else in the world.  

The fact that Japan is an alien planet located here on Earth makes it even more special (specialer?).

Iâ__m writing this because I think sometimes people...forget there are stars between one â­_ï¸_ and five â­_ï¸_â­_ï¸_â­_ï¸_â­_ï¸_â­_ï¸_. 

The Teun is that for something to be five stars it should be pretty exceptional.  I want to feel like Iâ__m experiencing something awesome when I follow someoneâ__s five-star review recommendation. 

In this case, I chose Shogun Burger based on the reviews available online.  I wonder if sometimes people give a high review only because other people do, or because restaurants offer incentives.  

Anyway, I digress.

The food was tasty.  It wasnâ__t the most exceptional burger Iâ__ve had in Tokyo, but it was a good burger.  Maybe I messed it up by adding fried egg and bacon to the cheeseburger, I donâ__t know...

As for the chicken sandwich, it was not too bad.  It was, as indicated above, neither the best nor worst Iâ__ve had. 

If youâ__re nearby try this place and please feel free to disagree. 

Healthy appetite!More,When ramen, miso soup, tempura, and sushi have failed to sustain you in your travels or your sake-fueled appetite cannot be satiated by Yakitori, and youâ__re in the Shinjuku district, you must turn only to Shogun Burger. 

Take it from a Texan, they got the...burger right. Even if you donâ__t go for the triple decker Wagyu patty burger and opt, instead, for the regular bacon cheese Wagyu burger, your flavor palette and appetite will be sent to bed and will surely not stir until breakfast.

Funny â__TripAdvisor reparteeâ__ aside, the staff here is eager, friendly, and clearly taking a risk here. And theyâ__re doing a great job. They have heart and great burgers. I work in the service industry and recognize a would-be hero of a restaurant when I see one and Shogun Burger is that hero. Give them a try. You wonâ__t be disappointed. It was a great follow up to our awesome time at Robot Restaurant. 

Domo arigato gozaimasu, Shogun Burger!!More,I like to eat Japanese food when visiting Japan but I always do manage to get one burger in usually to balance the Asian versus Western palette. I had not heard of 'SHOGUN Burger' before but as I was staying in Shinjuku it was perfect...for dinner on my last night in town.  I went for a double cheeseburger and 'upgraded' to Wagyu Beef patties.  I ate in and there was a short wait as all the orders are cooked fresh in front of you.  When it was ready I was confronted with this towering burger that was going to be a challenge to eat.  I soon got stuck in though (I needed a good few napkins I can tell you) and boy was it a great burger... Juices flowing, tasty and satisfying.  I got the set so had the fries and a coke.  For my personal preference the fries were just a tad too crispy, but they were again hot and fresh cooked.  I have had one other great burger, (a couple years ago now), in Tokyo that is up there with Shogun Burger, and that was at a place called 'Fire House', but I have to say from what I can remember the burger I've just enjoyed at Shogun Burger just gets the medal for the Top Tokyo Burger... Awesome!More,The wagyu cheeseburger is a triumph, and the fries were hot and crispy. An outstanding example of a hamburger at its best.  You should try one,Very simply the best burger in tokyo what an amazing piece of food after a night out.. Totally recommend this as the place for a burger,Best burger we have had in Japan! Good and fast service. Serves beer. 
Even a fantastic veggie burger!! Five stars from the vegetarian of the family.,Outstanding. So good went twice in fact!

Trust me on this, I am fussy when it comes to burger perfection, but these guys are nailing it!

Juicy, gnarly, smashed patties on soft steamed buns with the right amount of salad (although usually Iâ__m against tomato...in a burger!). The fries are brilliant too. 

To top it all of they have a good pale ale/IPA choice and the service is outstanding. Missus dropped her beer and the resulting smash was the cue for three people to come rushing over apologising to us, cleaning up and bringing a free replacement!

Unbelievable!More,Hands down, one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life.  

Shogun burger is only 5 minutes walk from the Robot Restaurant and has an English menu you can chose from, and whilst it may be small, they excel at what they do....Our burgers came promptly and you're able to watch the friendly kitchen staff as they work the grill.  The wagyu beef was fresh, succulent, perfectly seasoned and cooked beautifully medium-rare. The fries that came with (+drink as part of a set price) were also fresh, crispy and delicious.  

I had a cheeseburger and my husband had the double and we were both left wanting more! 

Price wise, our burgers, fries and drinks all came to a total of 3,456 yen (including tax), which was well worth it.  

We loved it so much we're considering coming back again for lunch tomorrow! â_¡More,Just came in for an end of the day meal with the wife and omg one of the best burger I have ever had! Burger to bun ratio was fantastic, right amount of spices in the patty and was cooked to the perfect medium rare!!...Totally recommend Shogun Buger
They even brand the burger bun!

The only down fall to this place is...I CAN'T COME HERE MORE OFTEN!!!More,We had just finished visiting the Samurai Museum and walked past this shop and was delighted to see a vegetarian burger made out of soy meat. It can be quite difficult to find vegetarian food in Japan so this was a must try. It was...delicious and a good price! Would recommend to anyoneMore,Thank you very much!
There are still few hamburgers with vegetables in Japan, but I will do my best.",None,
"very good in general
food was good also services
i will go here again of course
i would try more of there food
thank you for today,We have visited the place way back 2018 & 2019 everything was excellent.
Yesterday we decided to visit the place because we miss the environmental there and the hospitality of the managers and the taste of the delicious food.
Unfortunately they have served the whole...iftar food in 1 time which is makes our main course cold, the soup was salty, even when we asked the dessert they said no dessert but it is shown on the menu, they served the dessert after we showed them the menu but it was only samples (means not worst to pay the amount for what has been served) in addition the menu is not clear which make the served appetizers from their own. 
I don't recommendMore,We had our Iftar earlier and we are disappointed. We ate again in your restaurant because its the same restaurant that we ate way back 2019, where in the food are served not all together like what they did this afternoon. All the food are...served at the same time so by the time we ate the other food its already so called.. because first we need to eat the welcome appitizer the dates, then the soup for which is a bit salty so I need to request your waiter to add a little hot water so the taste will be okay.. so finally when they bring back the soup it tast a bit better. The Fatoush & Hummus w olives taste the same as before. Unfortunately when we are about to eat the main course.. The Machbous Lamb the rice is delicious but the lamb there's no salt so i asked for salt and then it taste better. The Shish Tawook since its cold .. its hard to eat. When we called the waiter and ask for Dessert, he said no dessert so I have to take out the pic that showed to him that there's a dessert. So the waiter gave us our dessert, but the dessert that was served to us was not the same way back 2019. The dessert that was served to us way back 2019 its a full plate and not small quantity. All of the things I wrote here I called your staff and informed our disappointments. But i want to be honest with you, when i made the reservation, i read the reviews and I informed my friend about the bad reviews I read but he said to me.. remember we ate there twice way back 2019. So when we finshed eating.. I said, see all the things in the reviews are correct. Hope with this feed back you will take this into consideration so that your customer will not eat a cold meal.More,Worst experience..
Average food...and don't expect authentic Arabic food..
They haven't even got time to remove sticker from tomato ..b4 cooking..lol.

Not recommended if you are not Arabic speaking...

Will never step in...,Restaurant has a very nice ambience. Staff Miguel who served us was very friendly also with the rest of staff. They gave us a very nice and excellent service. Foods are amazingly delicious. ð___ð__»ð___ð__» Thank you too to the manager who was very welcoming. God...bless you more!More,Bad service, dirty place, Iâ__m waiting around 15 mins no one want come to take my order.

First impression ð___ð__»
Im not recomend to visit this place.,We visited the restaurant as a special treat and for a mother daughter time and we had the best time. The staff were friendly and even wished my girl on her birthday.

If you are craving for Lebanese/Arabic cuisine this is the place to go.,Its 1st time i visit your store services exllente food wonderful and QSC 100 % and umali its was amazing thank you,A wonderful restaurant that offer an authentic Palestinian dishes like Maqloba, Mansaf, Frikeh and Mosakaa.
Big hall restaurant with a great ambience, nice and friendly staff and reasonable prices.
The open cooking area gives you a chance to see how they cook their wonderful bread....We ordered Mansaf, Mashawi, Kofta, Hommos and Boneless Chicken. Super food and service. We had a great time.
Thank you AbbyMore,I went twice this week to this place where we feel accidentally there.  we had their sweets the first time and their Kanafa is outrageous.  the second visit we had their dinner items.  Their appetizers were superb especially the Masakan rolls.  it was a very...clever way to have this dish in a modern style.  Also, their mansaf is to die for.  The kifta and batata (Meat and potato) was out of this world, I had never had such a delicious tomato sauce covering the meat and the potatoes.  Their dishes are very well done. This dish was so great with their baked pita bread.  I am looking forward to have their breakfast now.More,The food is very tasty, the staff is friendly , the service is very good. I will tell my friends about the restaurant.,Perfect ... price wise ... quality wise ...  hospitality wise .. this was my first visit and will not be the last .. strongly recommended.,I like the food and service 
The service karen good person and hospitality 
Thank you for such experience,As first time was marvelous food and staff and I advice every one to visit the place

You have to visit,Great restaurant for family and individual, delecious arabic food and sweets, polite staff, nice welcoming Thanks Mr. Ibrahim for your hospitality."," No, actually.. robots seems better than them.",
"Impersonal ; if you want to order your food on a phone app go and collect  your own cutlery and have your food delivered to you  by a robot this is the place for you.  unfortunately it is not the place for me and my...food was cold so pretty disappointingMore,I don't know what you ordered but our food is cooked to order. If you have an issue wirh your food being cold speak to one of our staff. What we stand for is what most people review well of us such us good affordable...More,the customer experience in this shop is extremely bad. I told the takeaway portion is so small for around 70 dollars and customer service in google start to insulting people. very funny and never this shop again.

Good price too atmosphere was really nice too,The service was quick and food came out quick after ordering on the QR code. The staff were friendly and efficient. Food was incredible and very reasonably priced.,The food is great and authentic thai cuisine.  Loved the pad thai and the curry. The only negative would be the quantity for the price.  Though said that the taste and quality is not compromised.,This restaurant is packed every day of the week & please join those in the know because you will soon know why.  Green curry chicken is my favourite Thai dish & that was what I ordered during our visit.  I have tried dozens of green...curry chicken dishes but this was the best ever.  The flavours were amazing and so subtle. My wife had pad Thai & was equally impressed.  Canâ__t wait until tomorrow nightMore,Last Christmas, DoDee at Little Collins Street was closed, so we dined at the newer outlet in Swanston Street.

Everythingâ__s great in this restaurant except the usual long queue and long waiting time to be seated. Dodee is one of the best Thai restaurants in...Melbourne-CBD with lovely ambience, prompt service, superb delicious food, and good value for money, especially the generous â__mountain highâ__ portion of meaty ribs in the tasty, spicy pork bone soup.

As we were leaving, the restaurant gave us half a dozen of Aperol Spritz complimentary as present to take home â__ what a pleasant surprise !!

My family love dining here, and I would certainly patronize again whenever Iâ__m in Melbourne.More,Since my last review in 2019 the service and quality of food and cleanliness in this restaurant has deteriorated ever since. 
The service now is basically non existent but replaced by remote controlled robots who bring the food to the table. The robots are dirty...and food spilled over not cleaned. 
The fact that the business is offering a 10% discount for paying cash but then taking the ""mickey"" of charging a 10% Sunday surcharge need to be looked at by the ACCC.  
Couple of years ago, the great and tasty food was the main driver for this restaurant. The food is awful and lost its authenticity, the owners seems to lost touch with the place - and that is a real shame.
Definitely not a place to spend any money in and there are thank god a lot of better Thai Restaurants in Melbourne.More,What a sad laughable review.,My wife and I had dinner here, after reading about this place in a media review. We ordered Tom Yum Prawns soup, steamed whole Barramundi fish, stir fried vegetables with tofu and jasmine rice.

The food was authentic Thailand style. It was interesting to see...an A.I. Robot waiter at work in this place. See my photographs of the robot attached to this review.More,Really enjoyed the authentic Thai food they served. I especially enjoyed the Tom Yum glass noodles. The dining area is large and spacious.,I got this Thai super lover friend, so we are going to Thai restaurant this timeð__¨ð__· This restaurant menu has a lot, many decisions have to make.

We had raw prawn salad $24.9, total 8 of them, serve with bitter melon & fresh chilli, pretty...spicy if you eat the whole spoon. 

I'm a bit greedy, wanted to try everything, so i ordered DoDee King Size $33.5 Tom Yum Noodles with Mixed Seafood, BBQ Pork, Tender Ribs & pork, Pepper Porkã__

Pu pad phong karee $22.9, taste is similar with curry with softshell carb, but not much watery, very good match with rice.

The whole fish on the menu is good too, guess that will be my next time.More,The Massaman duck curry had tender pieces of duck, and the flavour was exquisite. The red curry was amazing, the green curry was amazing. The flavours in these curries are similar if not better than at the hawkers in Bangkok. It is a blast to...come here.More,Went there at the weekend. My food came within 2 minutes, no wonder it did as it must have been cooked long before and just sitting there as it was completely cold

My partner didnâ__t get her food for another half an hour

Bizarre how...they thought that is appropriateMore,Its one of our favorite place to go to for Thai dinner.

We are novices with Japanese but we knew we liked sushi! The waitress was great and helped us to choose various dishes. I can honestly say everything was delicious and...reasonably priced.

We will definitely be returning! Was pleased to see there are plenty of vegan options so we can bring our daughter and son in law next time!More,Firstly with the positives. The food was was fantastic and I could not fault it. The dumplings and the tempura really stood out. Loved the Soba noodles as well. The restaurant was busy and it had a good feel about it.

The negatives. We arrived...at 7.45 on a Thursday night, this was our first visit.  We were finally asked what we would like to drink after 30 minutes and ordered food after 45 minutes. It would have been nice if on arrival we were advised that you were short staffed and there would be delays. At least we could of then made the decision to stay or go elsewhere. I would also suggest when guests arrive you ask if they need any advice on ordering as the menu is quite extensive and although very lovely.

I would rate 3.5 but that is not an option so it is a 3, however I am hoping it will be a 5 on our next visit as the food is definitely worth coming back for. I will also try some of the other lovely dishes on the menu.

Regards

NickMore,We found this restaurant purely by chance and were lucky to do so.
it was a Monday night and we had not booked but this was no problem as the place was almost empty. The menu is extensive and we were a little unsure what...to choose but settled on a set meal of sashimi and nigiri. All of which were tasty and beautifully presented. A novelty was the omelette offering which we had never seen before! Having wolfed down the first course we decided to try the chicken teryaki with egg rice which was served by the hilarious if slightly pointless robot as well as the waitress. Sadly this was rather greasy. The restaurant itself needs a serious up date. The tables were sticky and the bar area very dated.More,The food is fantastic- lots of choice. The bento boxes are my favourite.
The place is clean and pleasantly decorated.
The staff are friendly.
You can park out back (although this isn't clearly marked)
We'll be back!,Weâ__ve eaten here several times and at sister restaurant in Hitchin.  Have always enjoyed it until tonight where by we have left feeling very sad and disappointed.  The service was slow and food not its usual standard.
The soft crab didnâ__t seem fresh and the...duck teriyaki was well over cooked and really dry.  When we said we were disappointed we were told people complained when it was pink.  Why not ask customers how they would like it cooked?  I was asked if I would like it replaced but declined but it wasnâ__t removed from bill.
We are regular customers but sadly wonâ__t be back anytime soon.More,Been here months ago and loved the food and I still do. The menu has so much choice. The Sashimi was lovely and great quality and the Nigiri was amazing also. I tried some of the sake and then the plum wine, I didnâ__t realise...how good plum wine is, definitely getting that again when I come here.More,Welcome addition to Bedfords restaurants even though I do miss the Peking Palace! A varied and interesting menu which was served by human and robot. All tastes catered for and everyone was happy.,Really outstanding food. I had the beef skewers and the Angus beef main. Both were amazing. Well done! I enjoyed bring served by a robot and the friendly staff too. Really recommend.,Sorry to say that this restaurant did not meet my expectations.  The service was extremely slow ie no one came to ask us if we wanted drinks until I stood up and waved my arms around.  Never asked if food was ok or if we...needed anything.  Had to ask 3 times for bill and in the end got up and paid at till.  Stupid robot thing does not make up for poor service.  Decor is vile.  Dirty old fashioned ceiling,  sticky wooden tables and nasty nylon seat covers .  Food was okay but only just.  Have had as good from a supermarketMore,Large, varied menu, plenty of vegan options and everything is delicious and very reasonably priced. I'd recommend the sushi (standard and tempura!), veg tempura and tofu teriyaki. The staff are really polite and friendly. It can get busy, which I dont mind as that's the...sign of a good restaurant! They dont always answer when calling to book a table or order takeaway - but persevere because its worth it! You can also order takeaway via Go Getters I believe. There is a car park round the back just make sure you park in the Kazoku spaces as you could get fined. All in all one of the best tasting food in Bedford currently especially for Asian and vegan food.More,We've been a few times and the food is always excellent - there's an enormous choice and it's freshly prepared. Great for a leisurely evening with friends in an unpretentious setting.,We had been looking forward to trying this new Japanese restaurant and had heard mixed reviews.  We have to say we were disappointed - although the staff were pleasant, they didn't know what they were doing, what the menu items were and couldn't work any...of the systems or robot waiter!  However, this is the fault of management as clearly they had not been trained in anyway whatsoever.
So we waited for the food ...it took some time!  It was not good quality and in terms of sushi, supermarkets sell items that tasted fresher.  The main meals were OK but just nothing special.  We will not be returning.More,Can't really fault this place on our visit on a Saturday night. Swift quick service, amazing food, it has been well designed inside, nice atmosphere, apart from a group of lads near us to hat dropped the 'F' word too loudly a little too often....Food was great, staff were good, Sushi chefs were amazing. First visit of many... See you soon...
Arigato gozaimasu! ð_¤_More,This was our second visit to Kazoku Bedford and has left us feeling sad about the fact that the experience of eating such wonderful food was completely ruined by the unacceptably long wait ( over an hour) and the appalling service. We love the idea...of such a good Japanese restaurant in the town and want it to succeed so are concerned that other people will get the same experience as us. None of the staff were rude, but there didn't seem to be any training. There also didn't seem to be an identifiable manager and this showed by the general inattentiveness of the servers. Even though there seemed to be a large number of staff with nothing in particular to do, no-one ever gave us an apology or update. It seemed that the bottleneck was the food production. We were grateful for some mochi ice-cream given as apology but nothing much was said. We hope that the management will take account of this review and try and deal with the issues raised.More,Came with eight others for a friend's birthday. The restaurant was very busy so we expected a wait, but unfortunately our starters came in increments over a period of about 1.5hrs, then when our mains came they were very cold, and not particularly nice.

Our...waiter, Oscar, was brilliant. He was very apologetic and seemed to be working 5x as hard as the others around him. 

The starters were very tasty, but everything was unfortunately let down by the long wait, and then the issues with the mains.More", The robotic Chuck E is a waste of time - I barely saw him do anything.,
"The food is excellent.  I normally have soup and salad or a ghaballa.  The chicken vegetable soup is good as is the Moroccan.  The lentil is good, just not filling enough for me when I'm hungry.  I have had all the ghaballas and all of...them are very good with enough left over to take home.  They have lots of other things on the menu, but the soup and house salad and the bread & and garlic sauce (exceptional) or a ghaballa serve me well.  

The atmosphere works for families and friends and those who write letters.  Very friendly staff.

The interior was completely redone in the last couple of years.  It's nice.More,There are a number of Mediterranean restaurants in the area.   Palm Palace was the correct choice for us as it was authentic and really good.  

They are still following protocols and we found the restaurant to be welcoming and clean.   After we placed our order,...they brought us some fresh pita bread along with garlic sauce.   We also ordered a small hummus which was very good.  Their house salad dressing was light and tasty.  Their soup was really good if you like lentil soup.   The Shish Tawook was flavorful & delicious.   We also had their grilled shrimp which was tasty.  The entrees come with your choice of soup or salad & rice or roasted veggies or potato wedges with the dish.   Everything was so good!!!  Too bad we didn't have time to go back and try other items during out visit.  

We would certainly be back if we need to return to the area again.More,Hoda is amazing. She is alway there. The food is awesome. Great atmosphere, we love this place. A must go.,Driving down the 23 traveling and saw the exit sign...wanted Mediterreanean healthier food and had no idea this would be so FANtastic! It turns its the #1 Med rest in Ann Arbor and #20 of all 365 total in AA. Wow. Plus the best service...in town from Hoda and her robot assistant....she even blessed our family as we left. What a surprise visiting from California!More,Food was very good and Hoda, considering how busy they were, did a great job to service everyone (as did the seating hostess).,Went here in October of 2021 with my Uncle. The food was excellent. They were very short-staffed and had but a single wait staff for the restaurant.  Despite this, the food was great and the service was more than adequate.,Our brother-in-law's friend told us about Palm Palace. Given the fact we'd pass it shopping on Carpenter Rd, it was time to give them a try.. We're not strangers to middle-eastern food - been enjoying for years at a favorite East-Dearborn restaurant. Though it wasn't...crowded, it took time to be seated. 

We ordered the Chicken Shwarma Plate w/Rice, Lamb Shwarma Plate w/rice, a side of Garlic Sauce w/Pita Bread, and a side of Hummus. The rice was good and hot, however the Shwarma plate meats were both warm and could've been hotter. The Lamb Shwarma had a spice/season/herb taste and smell I didn't care for. Mind you I love Lamb, but not so much this taste. Plus, both meats were a little dry. Their Hummus is excellent and smooth. The Garlic Sauce was too strong for our taste - our favorite Dearborn restaurant's Garlic Sauce is smooth and milder.
 
Their Menu Tablets are okay to use. Just wish they had the 'old' readable book menus. We'd probably come back and try a few new dishes, but skip the Garlic Sauce next time.More,There are no words to describe the food from this restaurant, it is simply beyond believable. I was traveling with family members with ages from 80+ to elementary school and everyone agreed it's the best Mediterranean food we've eaten in our whole lives (including trips...to countries in the Arab world). The entire time we were eating all anyone could say was just ""OH MY GOD THIS IS SOOOO GOOD"". No other normal meal-time conversation, just comments on amazement about the food. Tasty, soft, juicy, seasoned perfectly, perfect texture, melt in your mouth meat, fresh, beautiful preparation, unique taste... These words just sound so silly compared to the reality which is off the charts. We tried all types of meats/chicken, seafood, soups, salads, etc. We are so blessed that we just chose this restaurant by random on Uber Eats, and after that we tried them again and again. There are a few restaurants I remember so well throughout my life and this one I will never forget.More,We can't thank you enough for giving us the opportunity to serve you and your family. Your wonderful feedback and review have brought big smiles to the faces of the whole team. We are so glad that you enjoyed our offerings. We hope to see...More,The first sign that this establishment is not really interested in great customer service is the menu.   It is a small tablet which shows pictures of a few items at a time.   No opportunity to look at the menu in its entirety.   But, we slogged...through it and found some things we wanted.   Part of the problem with just pictures is that with no descriptions one assumes that what one sees is what one gets.   However, the plates shown are for the benefit of the photographer only.   We had a couple of glasses of the Ksara Reserve du Convent though at $12 per glass, maybe a bit steep considering their cost is less than $2 per glass, but, it was good wine.   I specifically asked for the ""salad"" as shown in the picture for my dish.   The waiter apparently misunderstood and brought a side salad which was very good, but not what I had hoped for.   He explained that the salad shown was just a garnish and not actually on the plate.   The bread was good and fresh though I prefer it soft to crunchy.   Though crunchy, it was good tasting.   The soups were good too.   When we got our entrees, all three of us found the meat very overcooked.   It would imply that it is possibly made at a commissary off site and kept warmed through on site as it was ordered.   My wife's Shish Kafta was more like jerkey with no sauce, our nephew's Shawarma was also very over cooked and dry with no sauce either.   My Shish Kebab which I emphatically ordered rare was moist enough to eat, but more like medium-well than rare, and again, dry as it was, no sauce.   Many Mediterranean restaurants offer yogurt, or marinated onion, tomato, cucumber to help wash it down.   Bad as I make this sound, the flavors were all quite good.   The portions were way in abundance of what people can eat of dry very filling food.    Almost all of the patrons were carrying boxes as they exited.   This is a very bad sign in that it suggests the food was not digestible enough to clean your plate.   We were no exception.   We took our's home and all I had to do with my wife's Shish Kafta was make a lightly thickened lamb broth sauce sliced the Kafta heated it through and poured it over the left-over rice.   Delicious!   If this restaurant paid a bit more attention to food texture and level of doneness, the experience would have been much better.   One other annoying innovation is the little robot that brings the food out.   Because it disappears as soon as the waiter takes the food from it, none of the dirty plates from bread, soup or salad go back to the kitchen and we ended up with quite a pile of dirty dishes by the time the entrees arrived.   They do not get bussed until the bus-boy comes by after you've left.  The golden rule of good service is for a waiter to never go back to the kitchen empty handed.   Well, the robot always went back to the kitchen empty handed.More,Dear Brian,
Thank you and your family for giving us the opportunity to serve you and for giving us your business. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and your constructive critisim is something that our team is going to be discussing at our management meeting. Even...More,Ordered 2 entrees and two beverages.  Didnâ__t get the bread that weâ__ve gotten in the past. Asked about it and was told that they charge for it now but theyâ__d bring us 2 pieces Iâ__m guessing because there was a long wait and only one...server.  She was great but totally overwhelmed.  I get it.  But. EVER OTHER TABLE HAD BREAD.   I got up twice to check and each table had bread .  I would have paid for it.  Itâ__s truly one of the reasons I want to go there.More,I came to Palm Palace for a late dinner a couple nights ago... The staff was incredibly hospitable and friendly, especially our wonderful server Hoda!! I'm very impressed with the service provided. The portions are very large and the kebabs are absolutely delicious!!,I heard Palm Palace had re-opened to inside dining and went there for lunch.  The staff greeted me in a friendly manner and quickly brought my chicken vegetable soup, large house salad, and rolls with garlic.  They brought the salad without tomatoes and cucumbers, as...I requested.  (your luck getting special requests in this world is iffy)  The soup was hot and the food good.  I fully enjoyed my working lunch.  I have had other food there, ghallabas mostly, and I recommend those, especially the salmon and shrimp.  I very much recommend the place.  It has a quiet atmosphere and does well with families and normal folk.  Try it.More,I ordered food in the morning to pick it up at 7 pm. When I arrived there, 10/10 curbside Parking lots were taken and many other cars and I were wondering what to do. The line to pick up the food inside the restaurant was...large and no members of the staff were giving directions / informing there was a delay. I left after 45 minutes waiting and they sent me a text more than an hour later saying that my order was ready. They called me at almost 10pm to ask if I placed and order and they were only able to say that many people like me had their orders delayed. I understand NYE is busy, but they clearly were not prepared and as a result of this, I didnâ__t have dinner on NYE at 8pm with almost everything closed. I loved this restaurant but they were not ready for this.More,We ordered carry-out from Palm Palace for a change of pace.  The hummus appetizer with chicken shawarma and pita was outstanding.  The classic garlic and almond chicken ghallaba with rice was very good, although a little too garlicky for my taste.  I'll probably order the...conventional ghallaba next time.  

The portions were enormous -- we got three servings out of each dish, making the meal an excellent value.  And it was ready for pickup exactly when promised.More,I have been here many times and the food is always outstanding! Unfortunately I was working as only had a 30 minute break. I ordered by phone and the employee who took my order seemed to be in a hurry and got it completely wrong....I am now late going back to work and hungry â_¹ï¸_. Waiting another 1/2 hour now for my food. Iâ__ll know to  have them repeat my order next timeMore,Good morning Adam,
First, thank you so much for dining with us and for giving us the opportunity to serve you. Then, please accept our sincerest apologies for failing on taking your order right. Can you please give us the opportunity to discuss what happened...More", If that's the best she can do why not replace her with an actual robot at least that would be more interesting.,
"We had dinner at the Yakiniku Bar and had the most delightful meal ever. I am not a meat lover however it converted me when I tasted what they supplied.
Its a bit expensive however well worth the price.  From the time you arrive all...the staff inc the chef's made us feel welcome and such friendly hospitality. Keep up the good work guys and will see you in Hawaii when you next open your restaurant. MahaloMore,The only restaurant I bothered to review in my entire trip. The meat here is just exceptional, it melts in your mouth and I will not forget the taste. However if your looking for a steak its gonna cost you. Just do what we did,...have a small tasting platter for the taste and then go get something cheap from 711 to fill you upMore,My first experience of Waygo beef and it was so incredible! You can see the meet cooked in front of you and are presented with a beautiful set meal. So wonderful!,Came here with high expectations and wasnâ__t disappointed. Good ambience and really felt like a genuine Japanese culinary crash course, what with the Kobe beef and grill on table. Washed down with a nice red wine, naturally. The only reason that I donâ__t give this...place a 5th star is that the menu wasnâ__t the easiest to read, and I found myself slightly worried about whether Iâ__d ordered something I didnâ__t want to eat (if I known what it was).More,We really enjoyed this. You order the meat and you cook it on your own personal grill. The meat was GREAT. The portions, I felt, were a bit small. The cooks and the staff were really wonderful though. Def try it.,Although the place looks like a dive the ambiance inside is warm and welcoming.

The barbecue is pretty much your usual variety but what put this place on the map is the quality of the meat.

Everything I tasted was first class and the beer...was cold and smoothMore,We went to this restaurant after we saw the show at the robot restaurant - right across the road and unmissable really. We got there around 8pm on a Wed night and we were able to get a table straight away on the third floor....We got the pricier course with the two hour all you can drink option (8,000 yen) - everything was delicious! It came with thick beef tongue, the luxury meat set and some appetisers and tomato noodle soup to close. Everything was absolutely delicious, particularly the beef tongue. They have an English menu but the courses they only have in Japanese. We managed to navigate it with my rather basic Japanese. The waiters certainly try to help but donâ__t know heaps of English themselves (5 stars for the effort though).

Well worth a visit!More,Our 2nd time here. You must try it they have kobe beef and more. Itâ__s a chill place and they have a cool waiter too. Haha Excellent beeeeeeeeef ð_¥©,It was a great experience! We ordered a wagyu beef cut platter to share and cook. The marbling on the meat was amazing. Iâ__m not too sure if this is considered expensive for some, but as compared to our country it is so much more...affordable. The sides are quite costly though for the portion, but a must try would be the potato salad (includes a lava egg that oozes over your salad). Will definitely come back again!More,I love meat and have eaten steaks and meat claiming to be the best in the world, but this place was amazing! The yakiniku meat just melted in your mouth.
Don't miss it! (And don't go to the Robot Restaurant accross the road, it's dreadful),This place was 3 floors and each floor has different wait times it was kind of confusing. But we were lucky for timing we got in on 3rd floor. Luckily they had an English menu. We went for the luxury meat set. It just melts...in your mouth! It was pretty smoky in there from cigarettes and loud drinking for a Friday but great quality meat!More,My wife and I have tried so many yakiniku, from Tokyo to Kyoto, to Osaka and Kobe, to Nagano and Takayama (Hida Beef)... no matter what we came back 4 times to No Meat No Life coz it's simply the best of the best Yakiniku!,Great service and good food! Reasonable price...The beef and beer goes soooo well! The only problem is you come out smelling like BBQ!,We found the restaurant on tripadvisor and we were just chuffed! 

Since we don't really understand Japanese,  a dinner set seems most easiest option for us to try everything. It allowed us to try different types of beef and internal organs (!!). 

The staff may...only understand limited English. But they tried every ways to help! A trump up to their service. 

Tips: please have the hotel to make a reservation for you if you are interested as they are always fully booked ;)More,Went here before a show we were going to see. Took over 30 mins to make 2 portions of soup. It tasted nice but the meal and 1 drin came to just under 3000 yen.",Some of these robots have nice voices.,
"Well, I guess robots cooked the food. It had no taste, looked like out of a tin. It was just awful. The staff was friendly though and I like the theme. Nevertheless, is a restaurant and the most important thing es the food. We ordered...three different ones and one was worse then the other. Also most of the food was quite cold and taste all. I will definitely not go again.More", He told me that he is not a robot and again I could not know how to answer this question because I did not understand how the topic come to this point. He repeated 2 times that he was not a robot.,
"Was here for evening buffet. Lots of choice and food is amazing. Although not many Indian selection starters. There is still plenty of choice. Iâ__m afraid I didnâ__t take any pictures as was to busy stuffing my face. Would highly recommend.,We searched google for a buffet restaurant whilst having a few days away and found this.  The selection of food was great, it was tasty and warm and the staff were very helpful.  Refillable drinks were great, toilets were clean and we would definitely recommend...it.  Will certainly return if we are ever that far up north again.  

Restaurant only accepting cash at the time of our visit, unsure if that is a temporary thing but they have signs everywhere and ask before they seat you if you are happy to pay in cash.More,Clean, friendly staff and fantastic selection of tasty food.  We have eaten in a lot of buffet restaurants and happened upon this one whilst visiting that area of Scotland.  Had dinner there the first night and it was so good, we went back for lunch...the next day.  Can't  complain at all.  We will be back if we are ever in the area again.More,Visited as a couple, first time since taken over. Wouldâ__ve preferred card payment option. Quick service and friendly staff. Plenty of options available. Price a little overinflated but refill drinks available, Food was average and not the best quality. Enjoyed the visit overall and would...go back.More,The food wasnâ__t that hot but maybe that was because of the time? I donâ__t know. The tepenyaki bar was good. The coke was flat too. I was more concerned about what cleaning substance was being used on the tables. It said D10 on the...bottle but the liquid was clear. Itâ__s supposed to be pink. You need to protect people in the restaurant from this virus. Get D10 into those bottles .More,Went in for a meal today with my girlfriend and was blown away by the top class service we received from our server dean. He is an asset to the company!,Poor selection of food, what was available was very poor quantity and not very hot. Despite not being busy we were shown to a table next to the toilets having walked by lots of empty tables.,Went to Dundee today and found this Buffet restaurant. We were warmly welcomed by all of the staff, escorted to our table and a drinks order taken swiftly. The buffet selection is vast and varied and what we chose was very tasty and hot which...is sometimes an issue with self service buffets. Lunch was priced at _£10.99 which was good value. We will be going back very soonMore,We were there on Saturday 3 pm on 15 th January 22 one off  the worst buffet ever food was few and far between cold and sweets were nil and void don't waste your money,I went to the chocolate fountain and brought back my marshmallows and chocolate. a woman came over and said â__if you take too much we charge you _£5 extraâ__. I was outraged!! So not all you can eat!,Great fresh food. Loads of choice for starters, mains, desserts and drinks. Friendly and attentive staff. My first visit and I will be back.,Can't fault the food as it was all delicious.... However although we had to wear masks in the buffet area the space was tight and it was really busy.... Also tables were definitely not socially distant and it felt like we were practically sitting on...top of each other.... Sorry but won't be backMore,From start to finish!  I have never come across such a rude, disrespectful lot on my life. When I entered to join my cousin with his kids. I told them that I was exempt.  The manager insisted that masks were still needed for entering the...buffet area.  I refused to eat, and just ordered for my son.  The food was disgusting,  the staff kept staring at you,  and were trying to clear your plate before you even finished. 

Worse part was, it was busy! Why the hell people go there? They must be desperate!

This restaurant is a disgrace to the industry!More,I was at Yamms with my friend and I went to eat my food and just got starred at which isnâ__t very nice. The food is good but would like to eat my food without getting starred at.,Over priced, food not great, staff were friendly enough but hygiene of a few needs to be addressed, the smell of B.O puts you off your food along with them staring at you constantly.","You can choose from a variety of ice cream flavours, sauces and toppings from the menu and simply watch the robots prepare it for you.",
"Our daughter has ASD and loves animatronics. Her dream was to be able to visit Billy Bobs Wonderland. We traveled from pa on a short trip to go visit for her birthday. It was absolutely wonderful! The establishment was clean, the animatronics were amazing, there...were a good variety of games, the food was reasonably priced and good, and the staff was fantastic! We look forward to being able to return. I would definitely recommend!More,After watching numerous YouTube videos on the restoration process of the Rockafire Explosion band, I decided to check it out for myself. Drove an hour on a Tuesday eve solo to try some pizza and see the show. The pizza was 5 out of 5!!...Iâ__m a pizza guy, and the sauce was on point. Had a very homemade, flavorful taste.  Highly recommend the regular sausage. The show was everything I hoped it would be. It was awesome to just sit up close and see the detail and hard work that went into making this restoration of the characters look brand new. The place was very clean and staff was very friendly. Nice selection of games, although I didnâ__t try any. I will definitely go back and check it out just to relive some childhood memories and have some great pizza. Canâ__t leave without a shirt and poster!! Saw a family there from VA, and it looked like they were having the same great experience as I did, snapping pics and just enjoying themselves. For anyone on the fence if u have a long drive, if u want to experience the old â__Showbizâ__ time u had as a kid, or bring that experience to your younger ones, do it!!More,Took a road trip from Cleveland to Billy Bobâ__s Wonderland  (4.5 hrs), to check out Rock-afire Explosion. Did not disappoint. In fact, it was an awesome experience. Rock-afire Explosion was awesome to watch.  The show was beautifully restored.  Music choice was perfect with great movement/...performance from the band. The stage was huge and prominent. Beautiful background and awesome props. 
Billy Bob staff and owner went over and above to make sure the experience was epic and special. The pizza and food were super good.  Highly recommend.  Could not thank the owner and the staff enough for making such a special memory. Will be returning 100%More,My grandson is obsessed with animatronics!!! He has been watching every video he can find and talks about them nonstop. We drove from Michigan to go to Billy Bobs Wonderland and it was worth it. On the way there he said that he felt like...his dreams were coming true. Even though they were not all operating he still enjoyed every minute. He has a mind of an engineer and is fascinated by animatronics. He stood there and told us all about what the â__failsâ__ were as well as the history and how they work. He said when he grows up he is going to have a studio and fix animatronics so all kids get to see them. 

Only the two on the sides of the stage are operational but the staff was really great with him and opened the curtain so he could see them all. 

There are not a lot of games/rides but it worked out because they were not super busy. We didnâ__t have any wait and the kids enjoyed themselves. They had a special buy $100 in tokens get $50 free. We did the special and the tokens lasted for hours. We even helped get tickets playing games while the kids played and the tokens lasted a long time. 

We didnâ__t eat there due to food allergies but the pizza looked delicious. 

Since they are one of the only places to see anamatronics they should offer a experience. We would have paid to get a tour and hear the history. My grandson would have loved to see how they work and get a closer look. 

We had a great time and will make the 7 hour trip again. As long as the anamatronics are operating we will be back at least twice a year. 

Thank you Billy Bobs Wonderland for making dreams come true!!!More,Please call and speak to a real person before you go. Do not rely on the phone message. It says the Rock a Fire Explosion is up and running better than ever. Our sone loves this place and wanted to take his best friend. They...are both big fans of RAFE. We checked Facebook and called their phone to be sure they were open. Both indicated the were open. We drove 4 hours to find a sign on the door that they are closed until further notice! Two very disappointed boys and two irate parents! We left a message on the answering machine and spoke to two boys working at the Billy Bob mini golf next door. A week later the phone message is unchanged. Be sure to speak to a person before making the trip.More,A few of the animatronics were slow but overall this was enjoyable. Showbiz was always much better than a yucky cheese pizza place any day. The pizza was good our grandson had a blast and the games were very good. The place is a hoot.,Stooped into Billy Bob's Wonderland for some fun after dinner at Shogun.  They now have an outdoor Putt Putt Golf Course, and a lot of fun games inside.  A great place to take the kids.,So as a pizza place and arcade, this place is average.  Similar to a familiar national pizza arcade place, but in need of more attention.  But for someone who loves the nostalgia of old school pizza arcades, this is a must visit.  In fact, we...drove from Michigan just to visit.  Billy Bob's has the only original (to my knowledge) Rocka-Fire Explosion animatronic band. The original ShowBiz pizza band before the ShowBiz / Chuck E Cheese debacle.  The band is in rough space (Beach Bear was covered in a trash bag), but still entertaining and an instant flash back to my childhood. It might not be worth a 12 hour run trip drive for everyone, but definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.More,I went to Barboursville with my mom for a special trip with her, it was an incredibly long trip, and we had to get a hotel room, because we live in blumont, WV, but it was ALL. WORTH. IT!, the Pizza definitely among the much...better pizza I've tasted in my life, and the games were fun, and only one seemed broken.

but my favorite part, of course, was being able to see the Rock-Afire Explosion perform live!, I've heard people nitpick at the show being in poor condition, but you know what?, that didn't take away from the experience at all!

there were some things we didn't get to do, because they were closed that day, but all in all, it was a true feel-good experience for me and my mother, and I can't wait to go again for my 16th birthday, in my opinion, it was better than Chuck E Cheese's could EVER be, and I can't wait to go again for my 16th birthday!

my compliments to Mr. Rex Donahue for bringing Showbiz Pizza Place back for good, and I am beyond happy to highly recommend Billy Bob's Wonderland to all the 80's kids out there, and their families!More,We have cane to a couple birthday parties here and as far as the food, it was ok. The issues is that a lot of the games were broken and the ones that worked took numerous coins and didn't give kids very many tokens. Also,...the prizes are definitely over priced for the tickets. The stage show with the mechanical characters was ""run down"" and some of the characters didn't even work. I would love to see a CHUCK-E-CHEESE or GATTILAND open in Barboursville. They are a much better family value and kids definitely get ""more for their buck.""More,This has become a must-see place for people who remember the old Showbiz Pizza animatronic show as it is the only public one left ... but the animatronics are so horribly maintained it's hard to watch. The monkey had one eyeball basically popping out and...thats just the start its closer to the horror game 5 Nights at Freddy's than it is to the showbiz of your childhood.More,I LOVE to go here with friends, and my youth group go here a lot and we are never disappointed!! The food is delicious, and the games make us feel like kids again! Love this place! Great place for kids and entertainment!,Food wasn't that bad, but the place is so run-down it's unreal.  Especially the show.  It's an embarrassment.  If they would rebuild that, and maintain it as it should be, I'd have to think business would pick up.,This was recommended to us by a friend and I will admit the pizza was pretty good, but the entertainment was just something different.  Part of the place is a nice arcade and the eating/party area has a...Show time theater style set up with large...animals that sing and play instruments.  At first I was delighted, taking me back to my much younger days but after awhile it was odd.  But for little kids it's pretty much perfect.  The kids we saw loved it.  Like I said the food was good and the arcade was nice.  If you are in the area and have age appropriate kids, this is worth checking out.More,This place is great for kids as there are multiple games and things for them to do. Even adults have fun. Although I think my kids prefer a Dave and Busters instead. Billy Bobs has been in this location for quite sometime and the building...is dates with multiple malfunctions. On his visit, the air conditioning was not working in the dead of summer and they had two huge industrial fans on opposite sides of the building to circulate air. We asked why it was so warm and were told by the attendant that the owner is too cheap to fix the A/C. So there were multiple kids and families waiting their turn to stand in front of the fans.. Which didn't help others playing games. The laser tag area was even closed due to the temperature in the building. A plus to this family outing is that there are multiple games for every age group and they serve food. However, I was not pleased with the cleanliness of the restaurants area or the prices.More",Get a great breakfast and be entertained by a flock of singing robotic chickens including such famous names as Elvis Press-lay and Princess Lay-er.,
"I am still surprised where so many good  ratings come from.... well, some people seem to like the place and concept and atmosphere, many Japanese people.
But I had the worst fish and chips in my whole life, the noodles with a not-so-great veg sauce...my wife still complains about.

Two points cuz we have discovered sake on soda there and cuz the staff is really friendly.More,Thank you for coming us!!!
Sorry it took so long to get back to you.

Sorry to regret.
Thank you so much for giving us the opportunity to fix something that is wrong.,The interior was fun and the music was matching it is a great place to go with the whole family. The food was nice but nothing super amazing. The cocktails were really fun though!,Thank you for coming us!!!
We are glad to hear you that you gave us praise.
Please come again next time.,Having visited Tokyo, last April 2018. My daughter who loves this fantasy encouraged us and a group of friends to visit this dining experience. As we were close by we decided to do this, it was enlightening and most enjoyable. The decorations were incredible. Something...out of the ordinary, unusual this is for you.More,Thank you for coming us!!!
We are glad to hear you that you gave us praise.
Please come again next time.,This cafe/restaurant is a complete waste of time and money. If you visited the kawaii Monster Cafe first, like we did, this place feels like an absolute rip off. We initially weren't allowed to sit in a booth, but on a plain table in the...middle of the restaurant. After asking why a lot of times due to the very poor staff's English, we were informed everything was reserved. Eventually we were seated at an slightly nicer table and the next disappointment started. The food and the drinks. Although the food options look pretty small on the pictures already, the reality is even less. I ordered a cup of tea for a stunning 5 euros and was served with a tiny glass cup of tea and nothing else (see picture). We had a pasta with fresh steamed vegetables and the beef. Unfortunately the pasta was just plain pasta with canned tomatoes and a few cooked potatoes. Also after 
Almost an hour after the slots starting time the place was still pretty much empty and none of the 'reserved' tables were filled. 
Overall, please don't go here. Save your money, which is a lot, and your time!
(go to kawaii Monster Cafe, it's awesome)More,Thank you for coming us.
Sorry it took so long to get back to you.
I'm truly sorry that you had such a disappointing visit because of the poor customer service you received.
I can promise you that the highest  quality service will be met...More,I was charged double than what was listed on the menu price. Food took three hours to receive and was mediocre at best. Awful experience. Do not come here.

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.
I'm truly sorry that you had such a disappointing visit because of the poor customer service you received.
I can promise you that the highest  quality service will be met...More,We were excited to visit the restaurant as between my friends and I, we have 4 children and thought this would be quite an experience.  
Be warned that this restaurant requires you to order 1 food and drink per person. We did struggle to order...7 meals/desserts and drinks as we had a wonderful meal at Oedo Ayetori restaurant before. 
The menu was quite confusing as youâ__ll see from photos. The laminated dessert/drink menu had no description of items. We gave the menu to the children to pick from not knowing that the drinks were alcoholic! Didnâ__t help when the staff spoke minimum English. The staff did look at us funny when we handed the drinks to the kids! 

The truffle chips and chicken pieces were quite delicious, while the roasted crispy cheese werenâ__t crispy at all. It was such a shame, all they needed to do was to reheat it in the oven for a few minutes to make them crispy again. 
The presentation of the desserts were great, they tasted fine nothing out of the ordinary.More,Unsure where they hire the chef; I thought even  canned food taste better. I only had one bite of my food and decided not to go on; only the tomato paste is warm but chicken piece is cold. Overpriced menu, I was charged cover charge...too. Not even fantasising anything. Ruined my dinner.More,Alice in Wonderland Shinjuku. Cheesy. Expensive. Food tastes like dog food. Even kids didnâ__t eat theirs. Crowded. Service slow and impolite. Disappointing special occasion for a little girlâ__s birthday.,It started off well. The elevator kicked me out into a giant bookcase and 'Alice' came to find me from behind a book. I donned rabbit ears and was lead through a maze of mirrors to the main dining area. The staff were friendly and...enthusiastic, they gave me the menu and soup with great ceremony. However, the Alice theme was a bit superficial, after about 5 minutes you have seen all there is to see. The food and cocktails had fancy names but looked quite plain when they arrived. I ordered the English Muffins and they came out burnt.More,Really great fun experience. Yes youâ__ve got to wear the bunny ears 
Food was really good . Especially the sweets 
Great vibe 
And best to reserve a table as it gets really busy 
Popular for a reason,Food was really nice. Very cool decorations. Service was average. Cute book for menu good variety of food think we had an English western menu some other tables had different meals to our menu.,I would rate this as good if it were an option but not very good. We found the entrance a little hard to find. The instructions received from Viator said go down the stairs but when we arrived there was just a locked door and...a handwritten sign on the door in Japanese which unfortunately neither my friend or I could read. I tried to call but the person who answered did not speak English well enough to assist. Eventually we went back up the stairs and discovered that there was a lift that took us down to the entrance. 
Tokyo has a number of Alice in Wonderland restaurants and whilst this one wasnâ__t the one I thought it was, it was still a cute experience. 
As weâ__d pre booked there was a set menu of a drink and 3 entree dishes, a main and desert.More,Ordinary service. If youâ__re not a local, you get a different menu and next to no service. Once they took our order, that was it. They constantly checked on other tables. We couldnâ__t even get their attention to get the bill. The atmosphere and decor...was also lacking.More,Was not happy with this place. Super expensive and the food was not that great. I would not recommend. Paid almost 20000 for a party of 2.,We booked dinner here as a package deal with our Robot Wars tickets. We were very disappointed in the dinner and service. Had to wait a while to be seated, only to find many open tables in the dining room. None of our dishes were...fun or themed like you see in the website pictures. Portions were small and not flavorful. Did not get the whimsical feel we were hoping for at all. Do not waste your time or money!More",The servers are robotic and condescending.,
"The decor and ambiance is nice. Ordering from tablets is cool because you donâ__t need to keep calling the waiter over. The cat-faced robot waiter that delivers food to the tables is very cool too. And the food was of a good quality and standard....The slow service of the food let the place down and because it is delivered piecemeal you can forget what youâ__ve ordered or think all youâ__ve ordered has arrived and then order more which for us resulted in two extra plates of food being delivered than what we thought we were going to receive, we couldnâ__t finish it all and were charged extra for this uneaten food. I think this amounted to an extra â_¬8 so not a massive extra but one we would have avoided had the food arrived quicker and all together. My tip would be to take a doggy bag and take any uneaten food with you and put in the bin outside to avoid this.

They did however only charge a child rate for our son which was good as this saved us â_¬10 which we werenâ__t expecting

Overall the bill was still less than we would pay in the UK for a similar meal but the slow service is frustrating.More,We visited this place twice, the first evening was a brilliant experience- speedy service, great food, lovely atmosphere. The second night was a complete nightmare, the service was appalling! We sat for two hours and only got bits of what we ordered throughout the evening....The sushi was the highlight of our first visit so we mainly came back for it. We only got two dishes of sushi out of six ordered on our second visit, and the two dishes we did get, we were waiting 45 mins for. 
The food is very tasty, they canâ__t be faulted on that but when youâ__re sitting for two hours and only dribbles of food are coming out, we got more p*ssed off as the evening went on. 
Very hit and miss.More,Mediocre food and pants service. Over hour wait for food and drinks menu  explain  diabetic beg for even prawn crackers wait 1 1/ 2 hours needing urgent help. Claim no English. Until you say not paying full bill this resulted in my partner being thrown...to floor repeatedly kicked and his possessions ripped from him. This only stopped after assaulting me whilst throwing money at them. No sign of police that we were told were called as I wanted to press charges. I have significant bruising from this assaultMore,We recently visited this restaurant whilst holidaying in benalmadena. The restaurant itself is well laid out and extremely clean, the decor is lovely and modern too. 

We opted for the all you can eat buffet which was phenomenal value at 22â_¬ roughly ahead, the menu...had a huge variety of both meat and vegetarian options and also lots of sushi dishes. Everything was excellent, staff were extremely friendly and attentive especially the staff robot that delivered the food :) 

Dishes are ordered via iPad which was a really cool touch!! overall a fantastic experience, we will definitely be eating here again if we holiday in benalmadenaMore,Weâ__re holidaying in Torromolinos at the moment at we googled Sushi restaurants in the area and this restaurant came up so we decided to take a walk up in the morning to see the menu. The restaurant wasnâ__t open yet so we checked out the...menu and it looked nice. However as we walked away we noticed a table full of dirty dishes and left over food left there from the previous night. If the staff are that lax about cleanliness on a table so close to the window, how dirty would the rest of the restaurant and kitchen be? Especially when it comes to sushi and fish. Iâ__m sorry but itâ__s a no from our FamilyMore,Lovely Japanese/Chinese restaurant by the Marina. We had the all you can eat menu for just less than â_¬22. You order everything on a tablet ( max 5 items per person at a time ). Food ranged from Nigiri , Sushi, fried rice/noodles, chicken, fish..., meats and desserts. 
Food was brought to the table by a cat robot which was fun.More,We went for the all you can eat and had a great time! The staff were very friendly, helpful, and fast! The tablet to order was a very helpful touch too. I thought limited to five items at a time (some are multiple) was going...to be too little but I was wrong and we only managed 3 rounds! The robot also was very fun. Overall, great food, amazing value, would recommend!More,The service was really bad, we had to wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes for our first round which wasnâ__t complete. And the waiters are really dude, they didnâ__t listen to you when you say something. After all do NOT have diner at this...restaurant.More,food is acceptable but service is not. ordered some basic sushis and had to wait for 45 minutes. second time this happened. i am not going anymore. instead sukyiaki in fuengirola is of slightly better quality but normal service,Hi hongkong69, 
We are sorry that the experience wasn't as good as expected. We are sorry for the waiting time. Could you give us more information on the day you visited the restaurant? 
Thank you in advance. 
Inasia,Without finishing our food they brought us the bill and charged extra for the food we didnt finish (yet). It seems that they just tried to charge us more to make more money. After asking they couldnt tell us who was in charge and told...us we only got our 5 euro back if we finish all the food on the table. Never expierenced something like this before.More,Hi Laura, 

We are very sorry for the mistake. Our satff would have definitely thought you were finished. Because we want to prevent food waste we charge a fee for those who order more food than what they actually can eat. 

Best,

Restaurante Pinocho,Very good delicious quality food and lots of variety I loved it is the best sushi buffet in Malaga without a doubt 100% recommended,Hello Thomas, 

Thanks a lot for your positive review. We are delighted to see you again. 

Best regards, 

Inasia,Great sushi, but also grilled meat. Really recommend this place, great food quality for great price.,Hi AdetHerr,

Thank you very much for the positive review. We really appreciatte it. 

Best wishes,

 Inasia,Here the second time with my fianc_©e, forgot to write a review the first time. This time we went with our bellyâ__s more empty, itâ__s good to be hungry when you go to this restaurant. When you can eat how much you want for a...fix price.
The concept is great, you order 5 dishes from a tablet at a time with an interval of at least 10 minutes in between and if you leave food you need to pay for it. 
This makes you to not overeat! 

Great staff, quick and friendly service, and the food is really good! 

Will come back!More,Hi Bellen92,

Thank you very much for taking the time to comment. We are glad to read that you enjoyed the food and the restaurant's system. 

Best regards,

Inasia,An excellent restaurant. All you can eat dinner for â_¬21.95 is a bargain. The quality of food was excellent, staff were helpful and polite, under ten minutes of order to table time. Definitely will visit again if I come back here. A must visit if...you are In benalmedina. I believe the lunch time all you can eat is â_¬16.95 which is an even better deal. Thank you very much for the excellent food. I can barely walk now :)More,Hi LycanTongue,

Thank you very much for taking the time to comment and for your 5-star rating. We are looking forward to seeing you soon!

Best wishes,

Inasia,You know what youâ__re doing ð___ average food served as slowly as possible. Three of us barely had 32 pieces between us. Calculated fodder for the masses. Most dissapointingð_¤£ð_¤£ð_¤£,Hi Garycooper1,

We work very hard to offer a quality service as well as efficient, as our regular clients know.

"The restaurant was 75% full and we had to wait a very long time for service and food. The drinks were served but there was a fly in one. The Waitress seemed a bit surprised but brought another drink. Food finally arrived only to find...another fly in the rice. The Manager was snobbish, condescending and deducted the service charge from the bill.
This has been the worst experience and shall never visit this restaurant again.More,Amazing Passionfruit Mochi served by the friendly and professional staff - Namrata and Heena ably led by the wonderful Manager Anna G who is kind hearted and super classy.

Would definitely return back to Ping Ping as even Sachin in the Jems Street branch was...so welcoming and gave excellent recommendations.

Keep up the great work guys!

CheersMore,Great service from Umberto over the Bank Holiday weekend. It was a very busy lunchtime, but my family and I had a great meal, and lots of attention paid to my daughters gluten intollerance. Not sure what the Robots do, but certainly recommend a visit...if you like dumplings. My elder daughter loved the House fried chicken!More,Food was delicious. Service was dreadful. 

We opted for the _£40 per head bottomless brunch option with cocktails. The cocktails were served in jugs and the first one we received had no alcohol in it. It was quickly fixed. Thatâ__s said they are really tight...with measures and itâ__s pre made cocktails so not really great. 

Our waiter was a calamity! He broke a glass by the table and cleared less than half away leaving us surrounded with glass at our feet.  The manager stepped in and  cleared the rest away once we complained.  The waiter spilled sauces over the table didnâ__t apologies or clear it up.  At one point while my  friend had nipped to the loo, he picked up the soya sauce dripping it over the table and my fiends seat.  No offer to clear up the mess. Serious lack of attention.  Food was great but there were a number of items we didnâ__t get. 

Finally this was a _£40 per person deal so I was surprised to see other items had been added to it.  It was again quickly sorted by the manager. 

Faulty Towers springs to mind. It was a complete disaster which is a real shame because the food we did get was delicious.More,Came for bottomless brunch with some friends and had a great time! Was served by Saili and she was great, really made the experience. Food was fab and drinks constantly topped up. Great value for money and would definitely recommended for a bottomless brunch :),Came for a bottomless brunch with friends. Saili the waitress has amazing service!!! Offered us drinks when we werenâ__t even close to finishing our drinks before and made sure we were never empty. Her attentive service definitely made it worth the money!!!!! Will be coming...again soon. Best food too â_¤ï¸_More,My friends and I went here for a bottomless brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The cocktails were yummy, the food delicious and the service impeccable! Saili, our waitress, was amazing - consistently asking us for drink refills and making sure our glasses were never empty....Her service made the experience, 10/10!!!More,A good place to get a quick meal before the theatre.  It's a bustling restaurant, always busy, but the quality of the dim sum is good.  Jasmine tea also very nice on a hot day.,Dear Peter, 

Thank you so much for taking the time to review us and we hope to see you again very soon! 

Kind regards, 
Anna V and Ping Pong Southbank Team,heena was stupendously attetive and efficint. the food was tasty and nutritious. thank you for your friendly and efficient serviceMore,Dear Mr S,

Thank you so much for taking the time to review us and we hope...More,Always have a great time here. The food is great as always and always comes out piping hot and is delicious. Heena was exceptional in her service provision. Always a pleasure to come out. I'd show you pictures but the aftermath is a second round...of empty plates ð___More,_£35 for bottomless brunch is very good value for money. Granted, the dim sum could be better, but 90 mins of unlimited drinks and a large volume of food is definitely worth the money.

Thank you very much for your kind review. We are looking forward to having you back. Perhaps to explore our Happy Hour range ? Have a great day! Anna and  Southbank Ping Pong team,This place is not a true dim sum place as it claims to be. Food is bland, tasteless, one note across the board. Come to San Francisco, Vancouver, any part of Asia, it compare to nothing. Barely edible. You ask for vinegar, they donâ__t have...it. Like eating nothing! To top it off. Service is really bad. The point of dining out is be served, who hands the dish to you because the table is full, didnâ__t even bother to take the time to clear a spot on our small table.I even have to stand up and put the empty plate on their bus station. Not cool at all. Itâ__s a shame your in business and promoting it as a take  on a traditional dim sum place. You just ruined my holiday in to the UK!More,Dear c1kb68,

Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback with us on TripAdvisor.


At Ping Pong we always strive to deliver high standards of service in a pleasant environment and we are sad to learn about the issues you experienced during your...More,Lovely evening, had dinner with my dad and Umberto looked after us so well! Will come again - for the service AND the dumplings,Dear U5116YTkatyb, Thank you very much for your glowing review. We really appreciate positive feedback and will bring it forward to the staff and Umberto! Hope we'll see you back soon. Kind regards, Anna V and the Southbank Ping Pong Team,Despite the food being delicious when it eventually arrived, our evening was ruined by the shambolic way in which Ping Pong insists people order food. 

Rather than the old fashioned way of a waiter coming to the table with a notepad and pencil and simply...asking what we want, the menu is laid out and a piece of paper comparable to a shopping receipt. With circles to tick next to each item, youâ__re instructed to tick what everyone wants, and add a â__x2â__ or so on if you wish to order multiple of the same item. This might work for a small table, but I table of 6 we saw what was coming. The waiter took our tick sheet away and returned with it a few minutes later covered in an array of scribbles and crossings out, and also one portion of rice. 15 mins go by with just one portion of rice between the 6 of us before a few other dishes arrive. Weâ__re up to 5 dishes between 6 of us now. Weâ__re then seemingly forgot about for another 20 before we managed to get another waitress to check what was happening to the rest of our order. She returned after a long discussion with her manager with the tick sheet which was almost indecipherable. It was clear our order had been messed up, and we finally received the rest of our order an hour after we sat down, and about 40 minutes after we received out first plate. 

When it came time to pay we mentioned the experience we had just had to the waiter, which was met with a number of excuses such as the chef missing orders and the fact they were busy. Everyone makes mistakes, it they had just acknowledged that the waiter had confused the order it would be more appreciated. Itâ__s a shame the ordering system ruined what was otherwise lovely food, we couldnâ__t fault one dish we had.More,Dear 19752XLscottk,

"We ordered ribs & seafood risotto & loved it. The service was so polite & the wine was quality. Ambience is perfect nice & warm.,Previously came for lunch and enjoyed it so came back for dinner.

Restaurant has two inside areas - the large lower area as you come in and a step-up to a smaller dining area as well as outside areas for warmer days and nights.  Lovely,...cosy venue with enough staff to ensure you dont wait long for service.  Menu is varied and well priced with most (all?) dishes between $15 and $40.  We had bruschetta to start and the t-bone steak and prawn fettucine. Too full for dessert (well priced at $10)!  Recommend making a reservation so you're not disappointed.More,Great spot ... helpful, friendly staff (including the robot cat!), good range of drinks and great variety on the menu. We enjoyed fish and chips and fettucine carbonara - large serves of fresh, tasty food and a doggy bag to take the leftovers home. Restaurant...was warm and cosy on a cold afternoon with lots of diners coming and going. Definitely worth a trip to Macedon.More,We recently had dinner at the Macedon Lounge and really enjoyed the food. The carbonara and parma are must haves. The service was amazing as well, especially from their robot server, Bella.,We arrived at 6pm, had an entree which was dips and pita bread, dips were obviously not home made, a disappointing avocado dip, a beetroot and a spicy capsicum. My second glass of wine was forgotten and one of our drinks was wrong. Our main...meal, two Parmaâ__s and a risotto were large portions and reasonably fresh but they took 45 minutes to come out which is too long considering there was only two other groups of customers. While the robot is a novelty it was pretty useless as it brought two meals to the table but the waitress forgot to load up the third and walked it to our table quicker than the robot.  Booked for the following week on pizza night and one of our pizzas was completely forgotten. While they were good they lost their shine as our daughter watched us eat whilst waiting 15 minutes for hers to be cooked, some excuse about not printing the docket - not good enough really.  They apologised but didnâ__t offer anything for the error.  The dessert was dreadful, obviously not home made and delivered with very melted ice cream and cold sticky date pudding, very disappointing.   While the staff were friendly they are a bit disorganised and we were very disappointed after seeing other reviews. We will not be going back.More,We had lunch at the Macedon lounge today.  The food was excellent, the service very good, the outside garden lovely in the European style until the thunderstorm, then the inside area was just as nice. Clean, tidy, well looked after. 
In the top 5 for...the Macedon/Gisborne/Riddells Creek area now that we are locals. Good value too - highly recommended.More,My goodness! Meals were absolute crud. Steak you could not cut with a knife. Vege Stack looked like something the cat brought in presentation poor. No light beer. The place looked like it had not been cleaned for months. Windows dirty toilets dirty the beer...garden was terribly dirty. Staff had no knowledge about meals, meals forgotten. How they are still trading leaves me wondering. So $900.00 for absolute crud.  They need to understand that cleanliness & food go hand in hand. This place leaves a lot to be desired.More,Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the quality menu and establishment. A kid's area, a beer garden, and some quality ribs and burgers was an absolute treat. Highly recommend,Was pleasantly surprised by the beer garden at The Macedon Lounge. A huge space that pumps during the summer. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.,Really friendly staff. The interior is nice and warming. They have alot of outdoor seating perfect for summer. The coffee is great along with their burgers too off the secret menu.,Went to Macedon lounge with friends . 
Amazing food . Staff were welcoming . Highly recommended . Will definitely visit again .
Sheryl,The menu is a good and practical variety. The quality was good and affordable. The speed of service was good on a reasonably crowded night. We enjoyed the night. Good for Macedon.,Good palce to visit with family and friends food is delicious and was great as well. will visit again.,Good place to visit The Macedon lounge if u r in Macedon. Great customer service and delicious food. Strongly recommend.,Had an enjoyable takeaway coffee the cafe looked very nice for a sit down meal no takeaway snacks but after going to the bakery up the street this place is a dream", It was a robotic milking system.,
"We arrived for lunch after 1 pm. The place was rather empty by then. The lady serving was not friendly and not helpful. She pushed for us to order the expensive items and more and more items. We wanted to try their special dishes only-...so we had their Kinsa roll, a set menu with soft shell crab, foie gras soup. The dishes were good, but the attitude of the serving lady destroyed our enjoyment of the meal.More,We had a nice late Sunday night family dinner in this charming authentic neighbourhood Japanese restaurant in the modern HillV2 complex in Hillview in Upper Bukit Timah. We sat by the glass windows overlooking some verdant tree top greenery as the restaurant is elevated on...level 2. The Wagyu BBQ on 3 sticks ($33.90) served on bed of rice with an onsen egg was deliciously good and somewhat of a signature dish for the restaurant I think.  The soft shell crab maki ($9.80) was also pretty good, with the crispy crunchiness of the crab contrasting beautifully with the soft rice. The gindara yaki ( shio yaki or cod) was also beautifully done as was the ebi mentai yaki ( both priced at $13.80 each). All this was washed down with a 400ml yuzu pot. Overall a good quality Japanese meal in a very reliable restaurant that we always return to now and again.More,Had dinner there with 3 friends recently. We were celebrating one of the friend's birthday and the restaurant was very obliging, providing plates, cutlery n even take-away containers for the leftover cake, which we purchased from elsewhere.,This restaurant is known for their imported  wagyu beef and it is definitely well worth a try with its flavour and tender texture, but the serving bowl is small for such a steep price of 26.90 (not inclusive of taxes) and their onsen egg is...always served cold which clashes with the supposed warm dish. Their sashimi is generous with thicker cuts and one of the freshest, which would be one of the selling points of this restaurant, but is also pretty pricey.

Their udon and tempura is decent though lacking in more complex flavours I've come to expect from good broth, and can be quite salty.

Service is lacklustre as we were briskly ushered to a corner despite the place not being full. There was also a couple of flies that kept hounding us throughout the meal which made it very unpleasant.

Overall it's pretty decent but the atmosphere, service and prices leave it wanting just a little more.More,Visited Kinsa a few times and this time round decided to pack up and eat at home. 
The waitress was kind to recommend dishes that were suitable or not to pack for home. She was very attentive and reminded me a couple of times to...place which ones in the fridge as my dinner was supposed to be two hours later. 

The dishes that we ordered were all good. Kinsa maki was great and tasty although my friend didnâ__t like brown rice. The sashimi was thick and fresh (but not cheap). Poke was yummy too as the dressing was quite good. 

We couldnâ__t finished the garlic fried rice as we were too greedy but the rice was good even two days later when I reheated it for supper. 

Good neighbourhood Japanese restaurant that is crowded. Definitely will go back again!More,We had a booth (prebooked via FB) by the full glass window that looks out to the tree lined road which was nice.

Menu was sufficient for a group of 3 and service was pleasant. Sashimi range was standard but would have loved a bigger...range. We had salmon belly and it was more than enough to eat. Wagyu don was yummy and the seared smell of the beef fat was a treat itself. Poke salad was huge for one, and so was the carpacio poke. The purple maki was interesting and torched salmon on it a delight with each mouthful. Food came out so quickly we were quite surprised but nothing felt amiss. 
Limited seating and pre-booking is strongly advised. Not the most sophisticated place but good for a unfussy meal or even a simple birthday celebration. Would visit again if I decide to give myself a little treat.More,Depends on what one orders. I should have taken the cue from name and stuck to sushi. I made a mistake to order a set meal with soba. This was spicy, and trying to take on the guise of a bibimbap? Didnâ__t like the taste,...but thought it was a good idea the restaurant offers set meals with choice of side dishes - I had deep fried soft shell crab and fresh sashimi, which made for great variety. The purple rice maki was good. Fried chicken karaage was tasty n nicely crispy. My grand nieces had beef udon, but because of the sad looking beef slices, I felt it didnâ__t measure up to other Japanese restaurantsâ__ offering. Overall, service was good and prices reasonable. Pity the robot was at a standstill, so my grand nieces were not entertained by it.More,Food is average, aircon near window is not cold enough. Ordered fatty tuna and salmon belly - not so impressive as I believe the meat or the soya sauce has sugar in it. The meat tasted unnatural sweet. Th way it cuts also too thick...in my view with lots of the muscle grain still intact. The century egg Chawanmushi was great and served by the robot too! Trying hard to be Creative to make japan even tacos: salmon with brown nice and mintai sauce - Way too big and just didnâ__t go well with it. The Dontobori - rice bowl using the brown rice just donâ__t taste good at all. Worst is not using the traditional ikura ot salmon egg... need to improve in the creativity .. small and good quality is a key for Japanese cuisine .More,My family likes to come here for comfort japanese food! Nestled in the neighbourhood of Hillview, Kinsa sushi provides a alternative food option for those living in the west,Basically we have tried multiple jap restaurants from different chains but this is by far the most variety and injected a non traditional concept for their selections. Example chawanmushi with century eggs or salted eggs!!! And they taste fantastic!!!! No joke!!! And their other selections...are so wide range that you will be spoilt for choice! Making you want to come for more! Definitely highly recommended to all age and sizes... Hahahahaha....More,This is one of the best sushi restaurant in the West of Singapore that offers a wide varieties of food.

The menu choices are from Sushi to Maki to Carpaccio to Grill to Hotplate to Tempura to Steam chanwanmushi to Kettlepot Rice to Noodle to...Hotpot to Salad to Wide range of appetiser and lots more.

The restaurant is clean and nice. They have a robot server which kept some young kids entertained.

The highlight dish for my family were the Wagyu Don which we truly enjoyed.

This restaurant is recommended to those who wants more food choices at an affordable price.More,Kinsa Sushi Located at 4 Hillview rise, #02-02, hillv2 itâ__s a cosy little Japanese restaurant at HillV2 away from the maiden crowd. Hence, this hidden gem offers a family friendly environment that caters premium dishes to a larger audience with lower price points. Stand-out dishes...were The Wagyu Don, which contained pan fried wagyu beef on rice and miso soup, was prepared using A4 Grade Wagyu from Kagoshima Japan. Also on the menu it offers a range of its wide offerings â__ appetizers (Wagyu Tataki, Tamago Yaki), Sashimi, Sushi, Grilled Items, Hotplates, Deep Fried Items (Tempura, Karaage), Soups, Dons, Noodles (Udon, Soda), Bento Sets and Desserts. One unique feature of Kinsa Sushi was that they had a seasonal seafood tank near the front of the restaurant for you to pick fresh seafood items (seafood comes from various parts of Japan 3-4 times a week), and have them prepared in cooking methods of your choice. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More!More,Bad service, food is average. Waiting 40 mins for a katsu don and we are the first customer. Need to sent back and cancel the Katsu don because i can taste it was leftover, just re-fried. Tonkatsu was hard, burned, dry, and oily, seriously, it's...re-fried even when ""The Manager: Jasmine"" said default answer ""our food is fresh""

Came a replacement within 3 mins, definitely mine was recycle food. We decided to leave.More,I'm an avid sushi lover and if you are too, you definitely need to come over to Kinsa at HillV2 and eat their sushi!

I'll skip the cooked noodles (usons, soba etc.) and dons (rice) and just go for the sushi.

If you're a raw...salmon sushi kinda person, you won't regret the salmon sushi (3.90$), and their spicy salmon sushi (2.90$). Their salmon belly is priced at an affordable 9.90$ for 5 thick and fresh pieces. I believe they're also famous for the A4 Wagyu Beef Don (25$) but I have yet to try that yet. 

Hands down the best affordable sushi places in Singapore. They should definitely open more stores. They'd be a hit.

(P.S. they have a 30% off weekday lunch discount on selected items like their salmon sushi. If you're undecided about the place, go for that instead!)More,I really do not know why I've not discovered this gem earlier. I had such a great time dining alone, as the food and service was fantastic. 
I had the mentai roll (flame grilled salmon on purple rice that melted in my mouth) and cha...soba. Both were cooked to perfection. 
Interestingly they have a robot waiter to bring out the dishes to the table, which are then plated by the friendly waiters. 
Prices are definitely affordable for the high quality of food. 
My only gripe is they should not charge fifty cents for a wet towel. Next time I'll skip the towels and go for a bigger spread of food. I'll definitely return.More","The indifferent phone robot who took my order didn't ask if I wanted blue cheese or ranch with my wings. When I realized this I called to complain, and the rude and sarcastic second phone robot said if I wanted to pay for a side of ranch she'd send it.",
"Clovis is home to one of the new robot servers.  When we made our order we requested the robot deliver our food.  The robot was currently being charged.  When the food arrived, another server delivered the food, not the robot.  Disappointment!  The food was good....The service could have been better.  No refills on tea, but the coffee pot was replenished.  I had the chocolate, chocolate chip pancakes (short order) and it was like eating a chocolate chip cookie for breakfast.

The food is good at any meal time.

This is one of a couple restraunts all of the kids will eat all their food.  The food was good, consistent with IHOP.  I am giving it 3 stars because the dinning...area was not as clean as I would expect it to be.  The dirty dinning area put a bit of a damper on the meal.More,Fantastic food......how can you beat breakfast food??  The wait is the worst part, but you know that means it's good!  Our waitress' name was Paige.  If you can, get seated in her section.  Hands down the best waitress I've ever had!  Very welcoming, spot on...service and an amazing attitude!!More,Very good service, varied menu, consistent quality.
Always ok to make substitutions, very nice folks.
It's what you want in a breakfast place without the grits!
Country fried steak is my favorite !,Went to IHOP for breakfast. Service was very good. Food was exceptional. The restaurant was clean and cheery.,We ate here twice on our visit to California. Both times for dinner. Our service was always very good. The first night I had the fried chicken dinner that was good. The second that I had breakfast which was bacon, eggs hash & browns cooked...wonderfully. I have the crepes but with not impressed.
 The coffee was good and both nights we had excellent Servers. I recommend this restaurant.More,7/5/13
While visiting kinfolks in Clovis, CA.  we had breakfast here. This place was clean and nice but I was disappointed with the service. I ordered an omelet and a Harvest Grain pancake.  When our meal arrived it had a plain pancake. I told the...service that I ordered a Harvest Grain she (Marlene) said she would be right back. By the time she returned I was down to my last bite of omelet, everyone else was also just about done. For what breakfast and coffee cost now it would be nice to get everything at one time and hot.

"One phrase that undoubtedly describes this establishment is â__a hidden gem.â__ In an area of Canada dominated by tourism, choked with congestion and featuring a number of American chains that have little presence in Canada outside the city (TGI Fridayâ__s, IHOP, etc.), this restaurant acts...as an escape from the hustle and bustle that has come to define the city. It has a wonderful system, where you pay up front a fee (albeit somewhat expensive) to essentially have an all-you-can-eat experience trying everything on their menu, ranging from individual, simple sushi pieces to complex rolls to every imaginable skewered meat with a wonderful complimenting teriyaki sauce. It has great service, referencing both the very helpful human staff who will help understand the system, as well as the more robotic staff, who will slide on by with an assortment of dishes ready for delivery with a smile on their faces. The only additional charges incurred are drinks, which are good as well (a $12 beer flight is not an opportunity anyone can pass up), and contribute to the overall experience. Altogether, I cannot recommend this experience enough for anyone who hasnâ__t had all-you-can-eat Japanese cuisine delivered plate-by-plate by a robot, especially if youâ__red looking for an â__out of the wayâ__ location. In truth, we wouldnâ__t have even found it if not for a very helpful tour guide from earlier in the day.More,Dear Colt, we feel truly honoured by this spectacular review.

Polite young manager said - and I quote ""Oh yes, the chef has changed the menu, but...we haven't had time to change the printed menu yet"". Huh?  She did not offer to correct, replace, or even apologize and walked away.  A few minutes later she returned to offer a dessert.  My lunch mate requested ice cream which arrived the size of an egg.  We surmised my uneaten meal would not be charged for, but it was  on the bill which we paid.  I followed up with an email to restaurant. Rep called promptly and I reviewed the events. Although the rep was very apologetic and tactful & said he would look into it and call back - he has not. It's been over 3 weeks. This review does not address food quality as I had none.

First time at East Izakaya and the food was at the upper end of what we would expect.  Large variety to choose from, the staff shows a caring attitude and respectfully delivers or removes plates.

Karen looked after us very well. 

They also have robot servers that are cute as heck.

We didn't think we would need a reservation but when we pulled up around 6:30 pm there were people waiting by the entrance for tables.  There were more...cars pulling into the parking lot.  We placed our orders for bento box dinners and waited 25 minutes.  

We ordered the Golden Box (steak) and Premium Box (salmon).  Our server carefully packed our meals and these were not the usual foam containers.  We were amazed  at how much food we got for the price.  

The golden box actually contained steak and perfectly cooked to a tender medium rare.  It was so good, not many places offer steak.  

Both meals came with nice sized miso soup and wasn't watered down like most places.  The seaweed salad was fresh and we were surprised as most place serve a tossed salad.  

The premium box has sashimi as well as the usual rolls and was fresh as well.  

Our only negative is that the rice was a bit on the dry side but a bit of the soy dipping sauce made it better.More,Dear Lady T, thank you so much for this magnificent review!

They are able to accommodate for gluten free and will double check your order(be sure to tell them no tempura bits as well). The food is really good and great value for money.

Number 2- the wasabi they use is the cheapest money can buy, it is bitter....And the gari is dried out and flavourless. Number 3- the tuna roll is filled with escolar, a very greasy and fatty white tuna. Not red tuna which we are accustomed to getting when ordering take out. Number 4- sushi rice recipe is rice, water, rice wine vinegar, and sugar. Their sushi rice was also flavourless. It was missing two ingredient the vinegar and sugar which bring out the flavour of the raw fish. 

If you want to sink your mouth into a tasteless, bland piece of sushi then this is the place for you. 

On a positive note they did arrange it nicely on a party tray for us.More,Hello melsto88, thank you for reaching out.  We respect your feedback about our restaurant, but we consider your comments are not only inaccurate but also hurtful.

"This is a place where you can get simple Peranakan food at an affordable price. And becos of this, you can expect crowds to build up pretty fast, especially during weekend afternoon buffet teas. So it is advisable to make reservations early.,Feels more like a cafeteria than a restaurant.

Decent buffet with very friendly staff.,If you miss genuine Perankan cuisine, this is one of the few places to try it with free flow of food and drinks!,Food is great and rly delicious. However, food variety is not that great.

It offers a very full spread of peranankan food. You can start making your own rojak. Then some siew mai with chee...cheong fun and a very good chwee kuay. Then some kuey pie tee and perhaps mee siam or laksa.

That's just the starters. For mains, they are generous with all the meats you fancy: beef rendang, fish, chicken buah keluak, honey pork and kong bak pau! Of course there's achar and chap chye. All authentically prepared. And I say again, they don't are not stingy with the ingredients like the prawns at the laksa station.

I'll let you discover the full range of nonya desserts yourself.

The d_©cor is simple as they don't try to pretend to be a fancy restaurant. The service's cordial along with a robot coming around to take your used plates; way cool!

The fish head soup was great,I didn't realised there is this restaurant in NUS until my cousin invited us for his baby's first month celebration.
First the location, it's really out of the way deep inside NUS, will be difficult to reach there if you don't drive, don't think it...will be cheap if you call a cab; not mentioning that the place is quite obscure and many lost their way, bad luck for those who took cab. 
Food wise, I think it's just so-so. I'll just name a few, the laksa gravity was too watery as compared to the traditional thick gravy that filled your mouth with scent of spices and herbs. The curry chicken and bua kulak dish was ok and the ""pork wrap in bun"" was not too bad either.
On the desert, the various nonya ""kway"" were dry with hard texture as compared to the usual soft and chewy, probably left out in the open for too long? The sago cup is pretty blend, i guess that's why the ""gula melaka"" syrup is there.
Additional perks is probably the robot dish collector that came out after the captain announce that they are closing the restaurant for the next batch of customer where the kids went gaga about it and start volunteering to bring the dishes to the robot.More,Traditional Peranakan Nonya Cafe located @ 29 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, off Pasir Pasir Panjang Road, inside NUS.

I asked him if the side costs about $7 and he said no because the $20 fill up meal costs now just a little under $22. I found out when I got home that I had two sides of coleslaw and no vegetable. Why didn't he tell me of the price change on my meal and why didn't he tell me that the meal comes with a side of coleslaw. The chicken was not that great. I think I was dealing with a robot than a real person because a real person would have told me at first that the $20 fill up bucket priced had changed and the meal comes with coleslaw.

It didn't say even hello.More,It was fascinating to see a robot making coffee, but I would not go back for two reasons. Firstly, the cappuccino was good, but filter coffee was not impressive at all. Secondly, many of the operations undertaken by the robot was just pressing buttons.

Personally,...not again.More","The service was 3/5 and the waiter was more like a robot, taking orders and not talking much.",
"To he fair I don't understand why the last bad reviews. I saw somewhere on the internet good reviews about it, and even I saw the last ones here it didn't put me off about going. So I went there, on a thursday night and...to eb fair it went quite well, I ordered a Sauerbraten (which was quite delicious), and the place was so tastefully was decorated and, in general, there were such a good vibes in the place. The waiter was so nice and accomodating, by the way.  In the same street there are plenty of bars just in case you feel like having some drinks after lunch/dinner. To sum up, great restaurant which I would like to go again if I'm ever back in Berlin : )More,Overall impression wastainted within the first 30 seconds of walking in. I was excited to try the food based on positive reviews. I was greeted by a red head, I smiled friendly and feeling bad I didnâ__t speak German I while asking for a table...motioning with fingers â__for twoâ__... she proceeded to be incredibly rude and loudly respond â__CAN I HELP YOU? Youâ__d like a table for two? Yeah, full sentences please, I am not a robot ok?â__.. I said â__I know I just donâ__t speak German so I felt badâ__... to be clear, you donâ__t need to be a robot, itâ__s not rocket science, you are a server Iâ__m not here to get to know you, Iâ__m in the resturant signaling for two, no robots needed to determine what we need. I never assume the people I speak to in a foreign country speak English as it seems even more rude than just responding confidently in English expecting them to... I am in the service industry and never would speak to someone or gesture without words rudely, so I am certain I didnâ__t deserve to be spoken to like that, as she gained the attention of the entire dining room which was so unwelcoming and unkind. She continued on in a very condescending British accent as if to mock the remaining part of our meal. Also in 2020 you never know if someone is autistic, or mentally ill, so she she control her future service as sheâ__s lucky we were able to bounce back. Having not for the positive reviews I had read regarding the food I would have left. 

If I were to just judge the food it was a 3/5 experience. The pretzel was warm and very tasty. My partner enjoyed the soup. Both spatzles were a little cold, but had good flavor. I wouldnâ__t go again.More,Amazing staff.  Amazing food.  I see some people complain about not having a seat and getting turned away, but just reserve beforehand.  It is not fast food either, enjoy your stay, the place is cozy and welcoming.  I have lived in Berlin and visited this...restaurant many times, and return every time I visit Berlin.More,Arrived without having first made a reservation.
We were greeted with, ""Hello.Happy new year. We're full. Goodbye""
No further explanation.Curt, rude,impolite,utterly without feeling.
Quite staggering. 
Next time I'm in Berlin I'm gonna picket this place. In the meantime, this review will have to suffice.
I'm...white.My wife is black.More,We read about this restaurant online and we decided to try it for dinner. We tried two typical dishes and they were great. Staff is super kind and friendly. Highly recommend.,It is a small place with a small terrace near the street. The food we had (schnitzels) was very good! Big, thin, with a big lemon, cranberry sauce and patato-salad. Like it should be!,This restaurant was really cute! And it was located on a fun street. They accepted American credit cards. I ordered the cheese pasta, and it was the heaviest pasta dish I've ever had- very cheesy with fried onions on top. I wasn't personally a huge...fan, but others might like! They had some nice beers too.More,It's not easy to find good southern German food in Berlin. Many places just don't get it. In fact, I doubt that many kitchen staff in Berlin has ever traveled to southern Germany at all. So, I guess this place is pretty good, for those...who haven't visited Swabia or Bavaria.More,We were a group of 9 and the restaurant accommodated well for us. 

The menu was certainly different to anything else which makes it a really fun experience and to try something new, yet traditional.

Staff were friendly, and the food and drink very good...value for money. 

The menu was written in several different languages also.

Unfortunately there is no vegan option here, but I am flexible when it comes to travel and the vegetarian option was delicious.More,Me and my friends had a very pleasant evening at this place. Food was abundant, and very delicious, specially the pork marinated in black beer. The service was polite and helpful.,Waited 1 hour for the food - the pork with beer sauce was way too salty - other people who came after us were served before us - spatzel were good but not amazing /- good service - but no apologies from the manager -...last drinks offered for us starving- which is something I suppose - ð__©More,My partner and I visited on a Monday evening. The beer was fantastic and the food even better. We had two very German authentic meals. Big portions and the food and drinks didnâ__t take long to arrive. 

The atmosphere was relaxed even thou the restaurant...was busy. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.More,Sat outside this popular restaurant on a Thursday evening to enjoy Mac and Cheese and pork with noodles.  The food was really good and would recommend to anyone.   Beer was good also.

In good location with lots of good bars and restaurants around.,It's hard to find ""traditional"" german food -- ie austrian food - in Berlin and this is a good place for it - casual ish. I had the Wienerschintzl for those of you not interested in eating pork - it was made from veal and...took up the whole plate!!More,Great German restaurant in a lovely area of Berlin. Small but authentic and delicious choice of true German food with large portions. Great value too.", Love the robot/Godzilla decor.,
"The place is much bigger on the inside than it appears from the outside. It's set up so you will pick which type of dining you're there for:  Teppan Grill or Revolving Sushi. 

The Teppan Grill dining experience is like you'd experience any other teppan...grill restaurant.... you & your party sitting around the grill & getting a little show as part of your meal being cooked. The prices here for this seem quite reasonable. 

The revolving sushi dining choice here offers not only premade orders constantly cycling by your booth, but also a made-to-order optional offerings (ramen, soups, larger portions of rolls, & dessert items).  

Setup for the revolving sushi dining area includes two banks of booths that are each independently served by their own dedicated & continuously revolving 'track'.  Pick a plate of anything you like off the track (currently $2.50 per plate) & the wait staff will tally up the # of plates you had when it's time for the bill. 

You also have the option of ordering custom (or larger portions of the same items that are revolving). What's super cool about this is that your order comes out of the kitchen to your booth via robotic tray that rides on its own track above the revolving sushi choices. The robot stops, you pick your plate (or bowl) off of it, then push the button on the side of the robot which sends the now empty robot tray back to the kitchen. Very cool. 

We 100% will be returning to this restaurant in the future.More", They took out the robots and replaced with nothing.,
"I ordered chicken and vegetable pasta. Have to say one of best pasta i ever tasted. Great sevice too
 I order through ipad it was so easy.,We stumbled in here because the ramen place across the road had a massive queue. A vast calm space, nice after the craziness all around. Order on iPad, all very simple and the salads and pasta were very good! Spaghetti cooked al dente etc. A...big surprise to be honest plus free WiFi. Recommend for a pit stop.More,Legit the best coffee i have had in japan to date! Free wifi and charge ports. Rsther fancy place super awesome,Really surprised by this gem, the food for lunch is great and comes quickly, staff is nice, mood is relaxing.,Difficult to order- via iPads on table but he English version had very little English and wa a difficult to work. Service very slow, meals brought down separately (I was finished before my boyfriend got his) Food was cold and bland and expensive. Decor was...nice though and was the only quiet place in harajukuMore,My kids and I came here in particular for the traveling Kit Kat museum. The caf_© itself is fine, we weren't allowed in if we didn't buy anything which was fine. The customer service was actually quite slow and we were in the register line...for our takeaway order for about 15 minutes. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go back but it's a nice break for a coffee in a cool part of town.More,Good choice of coffee and a bit limited choice of teas (understandable a bit as this is Nescafe place). Good service and very modern surroundings with ordering through tablet and interior looking a bit like IT store ( in interesting and positive way). Robot placed...inside adds to modern feeling.More,Nice lunch, wide selection of lunch food and tables outside for us tourists. 

You order the food with an ipad. Full service but water you go get yourself.,This place is so trendy! The interior was what brought us in, but the coffee was equally good! You place your order using an I pad and there is a mini robot talking to you :) Never been to a Nescaf_© cofeeshop but if I...see one during my trips in the future I'll definitely stop by.More,I loved how this experience itself reminds me of whats so great about japanese culture..efficiency and quality.  the cafe itself is modern with white stylish decor like something from the jetsons and even a talking robot (he spoke japanese so there wasnt much to say...but he did watch me creepily from across the room).  we were escorted to our table where we punched our order in on a tablet (kit kat and coffee was about $3.80 ( 380 yen). about 5 minutes after punching in our order someone promptly brought them to our table like magic.  we were able to continue to use wifi for free on the tablet at our leisure.  also a cool concept, you can pay $10 or 1000 yen for unlimited coffee all day..this may be handy between hotels or on a dreary day.  we enjoyed it during the rainy day we had near harajuku and it was a good chance to hit some wifi and plan our next touristy thing in a cool placeMore,The extensive cafe. You can find towards Sendagaya from noisy Takeshita-entrance of Harajuku Station on your right hand side. They adopt  iPad mini for the order system was very interesting. 

The interiors of the cafe are simple, yet stylish and modern in an unconventional way....You also enjoy outside terrace. 

If you wants to enjoy delicious coffee and sweets in stylish space and at a reasonable price in Harajuku, go to there. 

Staffs are very friendly but I do not know whether they can communicate with English.More,Good place to have a break. Although its at Harajuku, such a restless city packed with so many people, here I assure you can feel at home. High ceiling, sofas, enough room between each table...perfectly fine, I think. Of course, not to mention, foods and...beverage are fine.More","The girl robot wordlessly slid across the table number with the incorrect statement of 'order, take a seat and we bring to you'. Went up to the counter and asked for a refund to which the girl robot found her voice and hollered for her manager that ""she wants a refund",
"What a shame.  ...We will not return to this restaurant while there is a Robot serving.  If we go to a restaurant, we expect to receive personal service from a friendly human  â__ not a Robot.  I donâ__t think it is appropriate to have a Robot going up...and down the restaurant calling out â__Hello, Iâ__m hereâ__ and â__Thank you goodbyeâ__ as it serves the tables â__ very impersonal.  A real shame because the restaurant serves the best genuine Indian food in Shepparton.More"," I suspect they may have replaced with robots, they were all so nice.",
"Iâ__ve been there multiple times 2 years ago.. but this time went there after a year and it was a horrible experience. We were there on a Saturday night and had an unfortunate accident where the glass bottle kept the speaker fell down due to...the vibration and broke n my friend got a deep cut on her ankle and the bleeding wasnâ__t stopping. What made it worse was the way the staff handled the situation. To begin with, they didnâ__t even have a basic first aid kit . We took my friend to the washroom to get the wound cleaned but there was not even a single drop of water in the tap and the washrooms were chocked . We informed the staff and she said yes thereâ__s no water . 1 lady ( in black uniform) came n told my friend so what if we donâ__t have a first aid and turned n left. A staff took us to a small room near the washroom where another lady told my friend donâ__t sit on this chair there are cameras. We didnâ__t go to that to that to have fun. There was an emergency and we were getting treated like this. 20 mins later after creating a scene they bring out first kit which was kept in a safety box locked which only had detol n cotton and few band aids. Are you serious? Even a normal shop will have better first aid. We had to take our friend to Lilavati hospital and spend 4 hrs there which could have been easily avoided if only the staff acted quicker. We understand that weekends are busy and youâ__re short staffed but they really need some training. Iâ__ve even informed the brand manager about the situation where he told me that heâ__ll get back to me and they have a team to take care of people in such incidents but clearly there was no one and I have to write this review and nobody got back to me yet. I would not recommend this place even 1%. Accidents happen but the way you react and deal with people says a lot . I canâ__t believe this is the same Younion .More,The review is solely based on my personal experience with the restaurant.

End Result: No one from the team connected after promising that they will connect on Zomato, also no reply to the email as well.

Unprofessional, biased, false excuses, negative greetings. These are the...words that come to my mind while writing the review for this.
It may be the venture of Zoravar Karla, however, such behavior is surely not expected from such a reputed owner's resto-bar.

I'm sure the PR TEAM / MARKETING TEAM, won't have any resolution to this, and at least they would copy-paste the apologies format over here which is also a rare expectation.

We booked the table from 8.30 to 10 at 7:00 pm, however, we reached around 10:10, hence requested the entry and upfront informed that we aren't asking for a table. The guy (with specs) said we are at crowd control so we cant allow u guys..I humbly request that we won't mind standing at the bar. Cut to 15 mins later a group of 8 people comes in and asks to stand at the bar, they allow. However, we weren't allowed in spite of a prior booking and top of that they had no answer when asked upon the reason for the same, on asking repetitively they answered that they informed prior were as they entered the name post we reaching there.

On top of that no one was attending the crowd and they were smoking a tad far from the desk, and we tried calling them they said to wait before answering such.More,Dear 9289Siddharth,

Loved the concept and the food and drinks are great. Sheldon is the guy of the hour who would look after all his guests even when itâ__s super busy....A must place to visitMore,Younion is the most lively place in and around Lower Parel. Theme is vibrant & Music was great too. The mixologists at the place take the Cake. Without a doubt much recommended. Sheldon and team ensured we were looked after well. Will be back in...the not so distant future!More,This review is more about the management in charge of younion. As a club its great but the management is terrible. The bouncers are rude to customers, use abusive language and I've had a problem like this 3 times in a row and thus I've...decided to never go there again. The management acts as if they're doing people a huge favor by letting them into the club and if you act like they're not doing you a favored then you'll probably be denied entry. I've been going out in Mumbai for a long time and all I can say is this is not how a run a successful club. There are plenty of clubs in kamla mills and even more in Mumbai. This place ain't worth it.More,Dear Madhav,

Thank you for sharing your feedback with us. We profusely regret not having met your expectations completely. It is the feedback from our guests that enable us in taking cognizance of the areas of improvement, for us to offer a higher level of...More,Younion is definitely our favourite place to visit on a weekend, from the amazing ambience to the extensive shots menu & great music, they have it all.
All the quirky neon signs and the beautiful decor makes it the most instagrammble place in town.
We...started our evening with some fun cocktails, mango margarita, the shaky peteâ__s ginger blue and the smoking skull Manhattan, each one had such a unique presentation and tasted incredible.
In appetisers we chose, ghee roast mutton  boti which was our favourite dish of the night.
We also tried the Andra chilli chicken, Mahim fresh tawa shrimp and the the tandoori chicken momos.
In mains, we tried the club tenderloin burger with bacon and sunny side up.
Itâ__s just so well prepared with the juicy meat patty, a good amount of bacon, lots of cheese and is topped with the sunny side up egg, what could be more perfect. Along with the burger we had also ordered the smoked shredded butter chicken and cheese flatbread which was lovely.
Just before the desserts we called for the over the rainbow shots tray, which consisted of five different flavoured vodka shots which were brought to us in a small ambulance, they do go all out in terms of presentation.
Moving on to desserts we tried the classic caramel cheesecake and the nariyal pani panna cotta, both very delicious but the later one was definitely more interesting, do give it a try.
And before leaving we had to try a few more shots, we tried the chocolate cookie, pom & choc, baby Dr. Pepper, Mudside, choco chilli and the spiced rum.
They have an overwhelming amount of options when it comes to shots, so go wild and give the interesting ones a shot.

On the pocket: â_¹â_¹â_¹More,Younioun which is located at the heart of party destination at Kamla Mill compound in Lower Parel. I went here with a friend and I should tell you this was a really great experience. 

The restaurant is full of colours, huge props and even entertainers....When you take the first step inside you start to feel the awesome vibes this place gives. The restaurant is huge with a lot of seating, but if you are planning to go on a weekend then there is a huge chance that it would be packed. There are many neon signs which make a great picture for social media. There is even a cage with a seat. A well planned modern furniture.

There are many props like the gauntlet of Thanos, Iron man's gloves, skulls, etc. We were also personally entertained by a magician named Pritesh, who came to our table and astounded us with his illusions. 

Talking about the food, the menu has a variety of cuisines like North Indian, European, Asian and even Finger Food. The staff is great and helped us a lot with the menu. 

Talking about the food we had,

We started with a shot tray which had six vodka-based shots, each one was different varying from minty to chilly flavored. The bartender made really good drinks.

COCKTAILS:

1) El Diablo

One of the most iconic cocktails in the tequila canon features cr_¨me de cassis, lime and ginger beer. Comes in a small bathtub. 

2) Smoking Manhattan

Combination of rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. Smoked with cinnamon flavor and served in a small skull-shaped container. 

3) Metropolitan Royalty

A really good mix of blackcurrant vodka and sparkling wine with some cranberry, lime and triple sec. 

FOOD:

1) Club Tenderloin Burger

A huge burger with a tender patty which is juicy, with mustard, lettuce, onion and tomatoes. Served with twisted fries on the side. 

2) Tandoori Chicken Momos

5 pieces of chicken filled momos cooked in a tandoor. Sesame oil is used which is healthy. 

3) Mutton Bhuna Flatbread

A big flatbread which is nicely baked with mutton pieces, along with pickled onions and based with cheddar cheese. 

DESSERTS:

1) Caramel Cheesecake

This cheesecake was just the best I have ever had, one bite in and it was finished even before I knew. The salted caramel sauce just adds to the great flavour. 

2) Nariyal Pani Panna Cotta

A flavourful panna cotta with the base ingredient as coconut water. The presentation is also good.More,We visited this place on a Thursday night but the ambience there gave us weekend vibes.

Loved the ambience and the Music.

Ambience : â_¤â_¤â_¤â_¤â_¤More,Visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening and it got really crowded with youngsters - my guess was that most of them were in their late teens or early 20s at best. Service was very good despite the crowds. Music was much too loud but...it was stuff that the youngsters enjoyed a lot. One concern - almost everyone there was below 25 and many of them were drinking hard liquor (The legal age limit for hard liquor in Maharashtra is 25). Am guessing this a violation that many restaurants that cater to the young crowd manage to get away with.More,Dear cool_satchmo,

We started off with Channa koliwada, roasted garlic, curry leaves a perfect chakna to our vodka based Cinder-frickin-rella cocktail served in Cinderella's shoe styled glass. Their Andra Chilly Chicken and Stir fried broccoli, water chestnuts were absolutely another delicious appetizers. El diablo, a tequila based cocktail served in skull shaped glass was yet another fancy and a cocktail worth relishing here. What's a dinner without momos and their range of tandoori chicken were absolutely finger licking good and so were the shiitake momos. And finally calling the garlic cheese, chilly flat bread was surely delicious every bite. We then ordered the desserts, which were yet another very well presented and scrumptious ones. The Nariyal Pani Panacotta is truly a delicious one to go for the love of panacotta. But what really I loved was their caramel cheese cake! 
Thanks to Mahesh for these superb suggestions and a brilliant service.

Detailed review-
I walked in on Tuesday night at 8.30pm and was surprised to see the place over half full, though it filled up by 9.30...

Loved the way they have done up the place... garden feel with lots of greenery st the entrance area... couches and high chairs near the bar counter...
A separate smoking section that has really comfortable seating too...

This place is famous for its shots!!! A 6 page menu only for shots! Over 100 different types â_¤ï¸_

Letâ__s talk about the food which impressed me a lot! Usually in pub type places food isnâ__t given so much importance, but this place really won me over with their yummy food dishes ð___
Chef Prashant has done a great job!

Chana Koliwada ð_¤¤ð___ veg - this was brilliant ð___ boiled kabuli chana deep fried in Koliwada style, wow! So delicious ð_¤¤ 
Though Iâ__m a hard core non-vegetarian, couldnâ__t stop munching on this ð___

Chicken ð___ satay - this was really soft as they use chicken supreme rather than any other part of the chicken meat..

Ghee roast mutton - another must try dish especially if you love mutton ð_¤¤ the mutton pieces were cooked so well, they were just melt in the mouth delicious ð_¤¤ served with 2 slices of garlic bread.. wouldâ__ve liked it better with naan or roti...

Butter chicken flatbread- it wasnâ__t sweet at all... loved the taste of the butter chicken topping ð___ð__¼

Tandoori momos - smothered with tandoori masala, these are yummy ð___ð__¼ the chicken one was really good ð___ð__¼

Chicken dimsums were good too...

Seafood nasi goreng ð_¤¤ - another classic dish, well executed ð___ð__½ð___ð__½ quantity is good for 2 persons... 

Chicken salad - grilled chicken with avocados and boiled eggs â_¤ï¸_ if you are watching what you eat, definitely order this ð___

Desserts - tried the Caramel cheesecake ð___ it was just mouth watering delicious ð_¤¤ 

Drinks - Cinder-frickin-rella ð___ was hands down my favourite drink ð_¥°
Cosmo - was good, Manhattan - strong drink, served in a skull ð___ glass ð___

Tried many shots and my favourites were -
triple chocolate shot, melon liqueur shot, orange ð___ shot, guava shot, j_¤ger shot, and so on!
If shots are your favourite, Definitely here asap!
They have a 6 page shots menu ð_¤© over 100 different shots ð___ð__½

Service was good ð___ð__¼ James and Shubham who served us, were attentive and courteous... 

Music was just amazing throughout the night.. as the night progressed the di played foot tapping music and the entire crowd was enjoying dancing!

Final verdict-
This is my new go to place for partying!
Coming back here soon in the weekend ð___
I have found my favourite party place in Mumbai! Have you? ð_¥³ð___More,Recently opened. Great service, food and music. Need to book in advance. Robots are present as well.","Placed an order through Starship robot which was well within closing time however after waiting for an hour and the robot still hadn?_?t left, I called the restaurant and was bulls***ed!",
"Terrible/slow service.  Most of our hot food items came out cold.  We asked to see a manager but was told he/she was too busy.  Bathroom was dirty.  Not worth the money.  Sashimi selection was small.  Will not return.More,Hi there,

Sorry to hear about the poor experience - it's definitely not our norm! Any chance I could get a bit more information from you regarding your visit? I'd like to dig into what the issues were you experienced. My email is Ryan@WindGroupInc.com.

Thanks,...More,This restaurant came highly recommended. We liked the ambiance very much and the robot server! When our (human) server asked if it would be alright if she brought all our food at once we assumed she would. My meal was finished before my daughter even...got hers despite trying to eat slowly. It was SO late we ended up just taking hers home.More,We were fortunate that two of our hotel's front desk staff recommended Wind and gave us WEGO directions.  We enjoyed viewing our options on the iPads and slowly working our way down the unlimited menu and the waitress was helpful when we knocked ourselves out...of our order.  

From the first bite of sushi to the surprisingly tasty ice cream everything was delicious. One round came by the robot waiter, which we'd never had before, so that was a bonus experience!More,Dear GoPlaces622353, we are super glad to learn your experience was a positive one and extremely grateful the hotel team recommended us, thank you guys! :D <3
We hope your vacation was fantastic and hope to see you again when visiting the city :),Went with a party of 7, 6 had the buffet and one has an allergy to fish so went with the a la carte.

I tried sampling the buffet food which was not associated with fish and was reprimanded by the waiter, they had no...right to do that 

My son waited over an hour for his sushi and when I asked the waitress she kept telling me that it was on its way until I started to raise my voice and voiced my opinion.

Wonâ__t be recommending this restaurant to our guests or going backMore,Hi there Simcoes,

We are fortunate to have you visiting us and hope to see you back again soon :D,OMG!!  What happened????  It was always our favorite place for lunch.    Sooo bad!  The manager agreed that they were having a problem with the kitchen.  Beyond chewy calamari, smelly, greasy, boney fish, cold no salt edamme, smoochsy eggplant, warm sushi.  SOOOO disappointing.  And still charged...us.  Gave us credit for the excellent wine. Go figure?  My hands still smell!More,Since your visit, we began to investigate your experience.

Huge amount of rice  and the sushi was great as well. I got a garden salad...instead of a seaweed....it was kind of anemic but still edible.

We are thrilled that you loved your experience; our staff will definitely be happy to read what you wrote. 
We put customer experience and satisfaction as our priority, and your review reaffirms the hard work...More,Food is just okay. The sashimi were lukewarm. The teriyaki beef looked and smelled great but there wasnâ__t much taste. 

Tables are far apart and the place feels safe and clean.,We are regulars at this restaurant and normally is it a 10/10 and we recommend this place to everyone. This time, we ordered take out and what a mistake that was. After just one bite of the avocado sushi roll and nearly came back up....Not sure what was wrong with it but have never had an issue here before. Unfortunately we might not be returning...More"," A robot started speaking, requesting to hear my order.",
"We came 2 hours before All you can eat time, when we asked for All you can eat the stuff refused us saying â__we have our rules!â__ We walked out, they prefer to lose the customers even in the empty restaurant 2 days before lock...down, than to bend rules and earn 60 euro. Customers are nothing for this place. Robots, robots, robots.More,The sushi did not taste fresh, it seemed to have been on the conveyor belt for a long time. We didnâ__t enjoy our meal.,Bad Sushi! Not Fresh!
Really disappointing!
They just served us the To Go ready Sushi that had not been sold.
They opened the plastic boxes and they just served it to the â__all you can it â__.
In front of us!
After 2 hours no...one made fresh sushi!
Avoid it!More,I've went into this place after seeing a sign of ""all you can eat for 9 euro"", when I took a seat a waiter asked me if I wanted a menu and I said I want the all you can eat from the spinning small...plates. I took few plates with most of the containing bad quality sushi with dry rice and smelly fish, but I've found few things I can eat safely with an ok taste.

When I've finished I went to the cashier to pay, and the guy at the desk told me my bill is 50 euros! He tried to explain to me in very bad English that I will be charged per plate, and said it's not ""all you can eat"" as the sign say. He called the waiter who served me and asked him about it, and he said that he offered me a menu and I refused, and that I had to ask specifically about the ""all you can eat"".

Whole of the working staff were Muslim immigrants (just a fact, not a racist statement), and I felt a bit threatened while they talked to me and demanded the 50 euros, so I had to pay.

Stay away from this place as far as you can.More,Came across this restaurant at lunch time and I always put my hand up for sushi. Plenty of plates going round but all very much the same, not a great variety, though what we did have was very good. The miso soup was excellent, the...best I have tasted for some time. I thought the price was reasonable.More,Had dinner at sushi circle a few days ago. Overpriced given the low quality of the fish, can not recommend it all. Service is ok though.,I went here with a friend of mine and we enjoyed our dinner very much! The sushi was very good and it was made at the moment just in front of you by a Japanese chef. There was a great variety of sushi and you...just had to wait for the one you preferred. The price depends on the colour of the plate and on the quantity you eat . We didn't spend too much money and when we finished our dinner we were very satisfied!More,We were 4 person including children who likes sushi in the restaurant . The food comes on a circle and the prices is according to the color of the plate.
The food was very good but because the plate are pretty small , without attention...you can continue ordering ...
We had to pay 90 euro for 3 children and 1 adt.
I recommend !More,Nice and cozy atmosphere, nice barmen.
You take on the conveyor belt what you want to eat and the price of each plate depends on the color. 
I always take a lot of plates. And you can also order in the menu what's not on...the belt. And they'll do it for you.More,good Food, slightly high Price, but typical Price level for Frankfurt. A good thing for regulars is the loyalty card,We stopped there for lunch and we got the lunch menu. A lot of choice of sushi, good taste and good quantity for a lunch. Also very good price of the menu, including miso soup and tee.,Our spontaneous idea turned to be a very bad one...
Rice tasted strange and sour. Sushi looked absolutely out of form. And the price!!! It should cost at least twice less then it does! When we are making sushi at home, it tastes 10x better...- and we use fresh and sushi ingredients only! 
At least, they have a very nice service.
Sushi Circle is definitely not worth it, and Im not going to try it anywhere else...More,I tried the lunch Menu and the quality of sushi was not good at all. I went before to the Sushi Circle of Bergerstrasse and it was a bit better (although nothing special). Then I wanted to give them another chance in schillerstrasse, but I...will definetly not come back again.More,The worst sushi I've ever had! Rice was very hard to chew and does not taste much. Price was too high for such low quality. STAY AWAY!",The robots are coming.,
"This review is for the MBS branch. Coco and her team were simply outstanding, took care of minute details and got us watermelon when we found the sauce a bit too spicy. They also allow guests to bring alcoholic beverages without corkage which I think...is awesomeMore,On 24/12/21 about 4pm, we went for our Christmas celebration in Haidilao Marina Square. First, it is in a secluded area of Marina Square with unclear signage of the exact location. Then we found it finally after about 15 mins to 20 mins. There is...no welcome cheer liked other outlets. There is only sad waiter & waitress. They looked moody maybe itâ__s a holiday. That is ok. We understand. But when reached the table, no active service provided. We have to ask for menu, drinks etc. But what shocked us as we used to other outlets passionate serviceâ_¦ this place is really bad. When the orders arrived via AI robot trolley, there is no waitress to serve the items, so we help ourselves to the plates, bringing over the plates to our own tables. In the midst of serving ourselves, to our dismayâ_¦ the waitress shouted at us abruptly saying that please do not take the items beneath â_¦ as there are 3 trays. It is obvious we are taking from the first tray which are items we can recognised that we had ordered. Mmm shouted at us, yes it is. CCTV with 10 pairs of eyes & ears are witnesses. We are all taken aback. Terrible is my cousin had to serve us the soup, then asked for hook to cook the codfish. All are not initiated. When we finally stood up to take ice cream, then someone finally noticed us as human & came to assist us to take the ice cream. 
Why expect so much? Because thatâ__s what the restaurant selling, service. 5 pax we ate nearly $450 plus & thatâ__s what we received, must well we order raw food from foodpanda or NTUC & have our own steamboat at home right. Since from serving soup to cooking are all done by ourselves. The ice cream is of Low quality. The fruits are not sweet but sour. The sauces are not within our reach. There is no manicure & pedicure service due to COVID-19, there is no performance â_¦ there is no welcoming vibesâ_¦ so what is left for Haidilao ??? 
All these are the marketing strategies but all these are absence in Marina Square branch. 
So I would not recommend anyone to go for such experience. Not worth the visit.  Unhappy thus no photo.More,the service was terrible, the staffs 
missed out our reservation for us, and we waited for 1 and half hour to seat us , this is totally outrageous. initially was fine, until then, we started getting unpleasant dining experience and no staffs noticed us and...checking on our tables and needs, so inattentive staffs and unprofessional at all ! such a spoiled the moments on my brother's birthday!
Please do well train your staffs more.More,This outlet is special with led panels and robot service!
Be ready to gazed at the ocean view and enjoy good mala steamboat with quality ingredients and good services,We had a very attentive staff, Jun Hong who provided excellent service at the Marina Square branch. We are a family of four including kids. I think during this Covid time, the company tried to reduce service staff, and I noticed each staff had to...serve more tables. However, Jun Hong is still able to attend to our needs quickly.More,Came on 6 March to celebrate a birthday.
Service was ultra slow. This branch supposed to hv the robot to help but mainly manned by staff.olace was understaffed.

Price for 9 person came up to $400++ but we had a $88 voucher so end up...paying abt $350.

Food was normal. For the collagen n chicken soup base, they pour the same soup refill when topping.i find the price was too ex.

Soup base at Beauty in a pot is definitely better.

One staff apologised to us by giving us a fruit plate. Server then came out telling her cannot after the fruit plate was served on tge table. She told tge other staff in our presence tgat as a fruit plate is already complimentary for birthday celebration, she shouldnt have given us another plate. 

She then took the fruit plate back. Server should not have done it in our presence. I felt that if she didnt want to serve us an additional fruit plate, she can just dont serve the later fruit plate instead of taking away what was already served on the table.

They also kept referring my brother's gf as the birthday girl as they thought she was the elder sister even when we informed them otherwise. So it was a bit embarrasing for her when the staff exclaimed that they had thought she was the elder sister who was celebrating the birthday.

It took another 15mins for the one server to clear the table before we could have the cake. So everyone was abit off. I wanted a tooth pick but didnt get it in the end as server forgot.

Generally staff was polite but i think the price is understaffed.

Came at about 7pm but could only leave after 10pm. We ate quite fast so mostly had to wait.

Service n food not worth the price paid.More,Staff were very attentive and service was good and professional.

Food quality was also very good and the price was reasonable (not the cheapest).", With IT-created human-like robots serving our needs and eventually rebelling - it's uncannily similar.,
"Me my wife and son walked in to this fast food placed it was in our local Walmart off to the left in side I think it was checker's l.o.l it was the twilight zone don't get me wrong I love checker's just not this...one the first thing the help was rude it was the lady at front corner no hello or a go to hell not even a God bless you so it was like talking to a robot  I said can I get 3 chicken box's they our $2.00 a box but now $3.00 now we still got those and a big Buford with a coke and fries its a copy of the whopper but this burger sucked it was a double patty dry need it lots of help more ketchup or better cook .and fries on chicken box's and meat cold the soda was not good too.it is a sham when people who do no take the time to get to known their customers it builds good come back again to see smiling faces not like robot's who say yes sir yes sir yes sir yes mam yes mam yes mam no suggested sales no bragging about there company yes it's a good company I've ate a lot of checker's places and they have great food and great people who work for them not this one. They need to put the secret shoppers back in to these fast food places to see how the customers feel's. So I will not mentione the things to eat heir I am a shame to tell you what to eat heir or pick's for now I will pray for this place and I will return at a later date to talk about the food for now no.so keep eating people. God blessMore,I decided to try this location since the Surfside location had closed in Late 2017, At the new location  I ordered a Rally burger, sandwhich was cold, and the cheese was even colder, no melted cheese They have season fries, which I do not like..., no options are given, slow service even though I was the only one there in early evening, the store clerk was running late for an appointment or something, and put  their butt on the counter and scooted off,  that really turned me off from going there ever again I shop at Walmart all of the time  I refuse to go to Burger king ( see my review of this place)  and checkers isn't too far behind I refuse to go to any fast food places where I feel like I'm not wanted there  don't these employee's know that it is the customers that are paying  your wages, and I notice that they were standing around  talking  so when I walked in  and place my order no one wanted to wait on me.  ,More", There?_?s a Starbucks where a robot serves coffee.

We will share your comments with the team in the restaurant to review and monitor your feedback. Thank you again for sharing your valuable review.,Service from mostly very young staff was excellent however the way they are treated by management was awful. I witnessed a male manager shouting at a young female member of staff on the shop floor and they were also ordering them about and talking down...to them.

Fresh tasty food, super friendly efficient staff - couldn't ask for more! 
Particular shout out to the general manager - friendly guy with superb customer relations.
We will definitely be back soon!,Thank you for the feedback! We hope to see you at COSMO again soon.,I can only compare this place to Silverburn and it is nothing like Silverburn in choice, quality or layout.

First impressions are good but when you see the actual food choices, you realise it is completely different to the Silverburn outlet â__ there isnâ__t as...much choice and dishes that you associate with Cosmo are simply not available â__ even though this is the lunch menu.

Food was questionable â__ I felt the Duck and the Hoisin sauce were â__offâ__ and didnâ__t eat the second pancake. That aside, I managed to create some unusual combinations without loading my plate to resemble a mountain which I hate to see at any buffetâ_¦

My complaint about this place and I mentioned it to Deborah who took my payment was the 3% discretionary service charge which she charged to my bill coming in just under _£3. The service charge for a buffet place, where the only actual service was to hand you 4 glasses for bottomless refills and clear away used plates. 

I only noticed the charge once I had paid the bill and been handed the receipt and of course, I made an issue about this charge in an almost empty place and a party of 4 people â__ a service charge, seriously!  In fairness, when I commented about this to Deborah she did offer to refund me and didnâ__t appear to get why I was so taken about and resentful â__ it was the dishonesty of it. Had I not taken my receipt, I would have been none the wiser. My bill was taken to just over _£80 for this lunchtime visit and I can guarantee you, that it was my first and my last visit to this outlet of Cosmo.

Take your receipt and challenge this dishonest practice â__ dishonest because they should have said they were going to charge it in the first instance. My revenge â__ well, even in a buffet place, Iâ__d normally leave a tip because thatâ__s my choice and my normal tips/gratuities are between 5% - 20% depending on welcome, service and so on â__ they got nothing from me as theyâ__d already taken 3% dishonestly!

AvoidMore,Hi Thomas. Thank you for taking the time to leave us feedback. As mentioned on our website and multiple signs around the restaurant, a discretionary service charge of 3% applies to all bills. As this is discretionary, it does not need to be paid so...More,Food was lovely, not keen on paying before we eat, it takes the opportunity to tip staff away when paying by card.
Tables are a little to crammed in.,Thank you for the feedback. We hope to see you again soon.,We travelled from Edinburgh, and we decided to eat in. And we enjoyed it here with lovely staffs. Would to visit again.,Thank you for the feedback. We hope to see you again soon.,I have visited Cosmo in Silverburn many times and standards are excellent. Un fortunately I cannot say the same about this one in St.Enoch's. Firstly, at _£19.95 per person with no discount before 5pm it's over-priced. The range of dishes was not particularly good. Some...were not warm enough and the chips were virtually cold. Some noodles had been cooked in too much oil. The range of desserts was reasonable, but there was no cream to add to the cakes and worse still, there was no custard except some that had banana inside it - not great if you don't like bananas. If you want an excellent buffet at a slightly cheaper price, go to Marble Global in Queen Street.More,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

So much choice.. Various styles of cooking 
Something for everyone. 
Even the fussiest will be fed
High chairs are available so everyone is welcome. 
Go up and load your plate as much times as you want
Very quick to clear...your table so no piles of plates lying 
Definetly be coming back to a Cosmo in the futureMore,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us, Andrew. We hope to see you again soon.,40 minutes before closing our group of friends headed to the desserts area. There was almost nothing left! Just some frozen ice cream and fruit left. There were no cakes or cheesecakes left. After finding a staff member, i asked them why and they said...that when itâ__s approaching closing time they donâ__t put out any desserts. So basically saying â__tough luckâ__. Absolutely ridiculous. You pay for a buffet and they canâ__t be bothered putting food out! It shouldnâ__t matter if itâ__s one minute from closing or an hour. We paid for a buffet. The starters and mains were satisfactory but its a shame we couldnâ__t try the desserts. In the end i had to apologise to my friends for recommending this branch. Avoid the St Enoch branch, go to the Silverburn one instead.More","There is a robot that serves food sometimes, and it made a mess by spilling food over itself and the floor.",
"Haberfield Rowers Club and Restaurant
Another great lunch at the club last Sunday with the sun beaming for a change, along with dancing music from the DJ as the sunsets. 
#HaberfieldRowers,Itâ__s well known that one shouldnâ__t dine in a restaurant that floats, revolves or has water views at the risk of being super disappointed.
The restaurant is ideally located with views across the peaceful waters of Iron Cove, and probably one of the few places...with such a pleasant outlook in the inner west (excluding the Balmain peninsula and Drummoyne/Rozelle).
So youâ__d think some enterprising individual would capitalise on the location and create food to match the position.
Average would be a stretch, this is food thatâ__s thrown together in a kitchen manned with inexperienced food workers. 
You can do better! You should want to do better, have some pride in what youâ__re serving and whatâ__s coming out of your kitchen. Throw out the frozen crap, find yourself a number of good providores, hire a young up and coming chef with vision and turn this into the star of the inner west.
The location deserves more than a pedestrian RSL kitchen experience.More,Very disappointed with meals and service 
We were 6 adults ordering entrees and mains- all dishes brought to table at same time! General feeling at table was meals average at best and over priced for what was offered- then hurried out by 9.30
Donâ__t bother...plenty of other good places surrounding this jointMore,Visited this establishment on the day before the COVID lockdown began in Sydney. The morning was great with views over the bay and a nice brunch menu. The Harrisa Chickpea bake was a very enjoyable meal while the Big Breakfast is top of the list...for the next visit. Great coffee with good serviceMore,Food is great club style , good size servings.  Good wine list.  Tables well spaced so there is room to move.

Service is great and friendly.

Only one negative issues ... the music is too loud.,This could be a nice place. The view is nice the service is great but itâ__s just not worth the money. 
The chia bowl to be honest was a complete rip. There was literally half a cup of chia which was soaked in a very...sour tasting yoghurt it actually tasted like throw up. We actually finished our meals and had to go down stairs and get a bacon and egg roll. The coffee was great though and the concierge waiter was lovely but value for money I can honestly say we wonâ__t be back.More,Whilst the views are nice they are not spectacular and it's worth remembering it isn't an ocean view but a bay view.  Without being overly critical it is basically a club bistro with a menu that is very limited with excessive prices. The waiter we...had was excellent. It seemed that in order to cut costs this poor man was the only one on doing the run of meals from the kitchen to all the tables. He done a great job. Fish and chips for $26 at a club bistro is way over the top and was nothing special when it came to the table. Seafood Linguini read "" Mussels, market fish, prawn bisque, fresh herbs and chilli"". 3 mussels, 2 prawns, and 6 x miniscule pieces of salmon. No taste of chilli and no hint of herbs. $30 for this is an over the top price for a club bistro. The Six Spiced Fried Chicken Bowl was okay but should have been sub $20 not $22. The Chargrilled Beef Striploin was all right but again $29 in this environment and for the portion size of the meal it was excessive. The setting was nice but basic. Parking is abysmal and we had to park half a kilometre down the road and walk. Not likely to go back.More,I walk past the club daily and the poster in the window advertised happy hour Monday to Friday. This evening wr arrived only to find the club is closed. Poster still in window though. Maybe a good idea to remove posteg and advertise your hours...clearly on the website etc. I checked the website and it did not clearly define your hours. Other clubs are now open normally. Please advertise what your plans are.  Brunch only!â__  You will not survive.More,UTS Rowers is a nice place to enjoy Friday night dinner with friends.  We watched the sun go down enjoying a cold beer on a perfect March night.   The waitress was very attentive and prices reasonable.  All 5 meals were good.  The fish & chips...a good size with a Great salad (not just an afterthought) the pumpkin ravioli also very nice. I also enjoyed the lemongrass panacotta desert.  It was very delicate.  Nice setting with good pub food.More,Venue is excellent but I would say food is better with more variety at neighbouring Rowers club. When very busy, expect to wait along time for your food!,Had a roast pumpkin salad and was not sure what to expect. The food was very good, very tasty and quite different. My partner had the Caesar Salad which again was well prepared. Great view, nice location and good service. Medium priced.,We were taken to the UTS Rowing Club and our colleague was surprised to have to pay a 15 AUD annual membership fee in order to be allowed in, and being from outside of the local area, Mrs FB2000 and I had to be signed...in. However, the membership did entitle 10% off the bill.

The carpark is small and was full when we arrived for lunch just after 1.30pm, but fortunately a car was leaving so we were able to take that space.

We sat outside on the terrace, with superb views across the river, and with a gentle breeze it was very relaxing. Mrs FB2000 ordered 6 oysters as a starter, but unfortunately, they were not served on ice, but rather on what looked like broken glass and may have been salt. She did not enjoy them, nor did she enjoy her chicken pieces on a skewer, which was described as â__not nice â__.

However, my Chicken Salad was fresh and came with a tasty dressing. It was served with two anchovies, which were not listed on the menu, which I picked out and gave to Mrs FB2000.

The waiter said it was his second day working here, and he was confused when Mrs FB2000 changed her wine order from a Chardonnay to a Pinot Grigot, and two glasses were served. This was not a problem though as we drunk both !

Cash payment was not possible, only credit/debit cards are accepted.More,A wonderful place for family and friends. Service is consistently good and food fabulous. The view is lovely on a sunny day or afternoon. It is also a perfect place if you have aged family and friends - with very convenient disabled parking  and bathroom...facilities and sympathetic staffMore,Overall this is a nice place but Iâ__m more likely to return for just a drink rather than a meal a little over priced. Thereâ__s a good choice of mains. We had fish of the day. 
The dessert menu is very disappointing. They need a...couple more choices and especially something with chocolate in it. The pavlova was just cream mainly. Not great. 
The service was good except for closing the kitchen before asking us if we wanted dessert. But then they did allow us.More,The air conditioning wasnâ__t working when we had lunch at UTS yesterday and it was very hot.  We were told that the air conditioning would not be repaired. 

Instead, it would be replaced with two large, unsightly, rented evaporative coolers, sitting on the restaurant floor....These are known as â__swamp coolersâ__ and are not air conditioners.  They do not work in humid conditions (Sydney in February).

The new â__table service with linen tableclothsâ__ is not an improvement.  The perspiring waiters were pleasant but found it difficult to keep up with the orders in the large dining area. There seemed to be a lack of direction and organisation in the restaurant/management. 

The food has increased in price, is mediocre to poor, and the choice is limited.  

This is a great pity.  We have been regulars at UTS since the big renovation years ago, when the air conditioning was first installed. 

The restaurant appears to be reverting to the â__pre-renovationâ__ era of the â__bad old daysâ__.  We will not be back until the food improves and the weather cools. down.More", Guests who line up for a table can be entertained by free nails deco service or enjoy the free drink and fruits which self-served or served by a robot.,
"I usually go to Mrs Pho at Rangoon Road. So this was my first time here.

Their Beef Pho was tasty as usual, and you don't feel thirsty after eating it. Today beef was a tad bit overcooked though.

There are many other dishes to...try, but I had something simpler for lunch, just pho and springroll.

I love their Salted Lemonade ð___

The robot is cute and helpful, but thought it was overkill when we asked for chilli, then they make the robot deliver just the sliced chill.

So when i wanted lime, I thought I better walk to get it myself, instead of creating more carbon footprint.

#choowai2022 #wongchoowaieats #wongchoowai #pho #mrspho #vietnamese #vietnamesefood #sgfoodinfluencers #sgfoodies #sgfoodbloggers #lunch #beachroadMore,Authentic Vietnamese food in a refreshing decor with friendly service, including a talking robot server! Vietnamese Specialties Set for 2 include Pork with Rice Noodles, mixed wrap platter, Stir-fried Luffa with oyster mushrooms, frog legs curry, cockles in garlic, lime juice & chili sauce. Finished...by sweet coconut & agar agar dessert.More,My wife and I went for dinner last night. Sadly itâ__s not the same quality and taste than before the move from Beach Road to Bussorah Street. The broth of the Pho Gha lacked in depth and flavor, the chicken was not as good as...we are used to and no condiments like chili and lime are provided anymore. We also ordered the calamari wir tamarind sauce which are basically standard fried frozen calamari and the sauce was only provided after we asked.
The chicken and mango salad was good but sadly could not save the rest of the meal.
Donâ__t know if something changed regarding ownership with Gourmet Food Holdings but sadly itâ__s not the same level as before anymore.More,We were in the Beach Road area and picked this place as we got consensus from all the kids for Vietnamese. It was a good decision as it turns out. The place a narrow outlet facing Beach Road. We came here on a Monday evening...and the place was pretty packed up for a weekday. Managed to get two tables from our family of 6. Ordering process is simple = just check off what you want on a piece of paper and pass it to the waitress.

Kids and I had variation of soup or dry noodles. Beef Pho soup was rich and beef done nicely. The appetisers like the spring rolls and meat balls were off thr fryer and savoury.

No alcohol served here. Hence I had the drip coffee. It was a proper drip with fresh ground powder dripped through - so have to wait, just like all good things, it's worth the wait.

Glad we came here. All of us satisfied and we did order seconds for some of the appitisers.More,Not expecting the fresh spring rolls we get in Sydney and New York, those we had here were small, tough and dry. Clearly prepared hours ago. Fried prawn on sugar cane sticks were oily and tiny. Smallest cockles I have ever seen and not fresh...cos most shells didn't open after cooked.  Found cockroach running across the table when we were eating. Waitress said roaches were a sign they just had pest control service. Clearly, a lame excuse that came from being used to cockroaches around or she had no clue what hygiene is all about.More,The service standard here seems to be set at a really high standard as we were greeted by a server and promptly seated. After our orders were taken, the same server approached us within the next 2 minutes to apologise for the ""long"" waiting time...and said it usually takes a lot faster.
We were served within 5 minutes - we ordered 2 bowls of the combination beef pho that comes with an extra bowl of soup with egg. The food tastes great as usual, and I honestly really like the run-down feeling of this establishment as it adds to the experience of dining there.More,Open 6 years ago ... the food is NOT authentic ... TOO MUCH MSG ...so miser with the sauce .... no LEMON for PHO !! the place is not clean and horrible toilet ... not comfortable to sit !!!! Our first and our last time...!More,Authentic Vietnamese cuisine. Pho & Salt Lemon drink is best 
Several locations in Sg
Best to take cash,We visited this eatery on a Sunday night arriving at 7.30pm.  Being a rainy evening, there was no queue and a table was arranged for our party of 5.

We ordered Pho Bo Tai (sliced beef pho), Pho Bo Tai Nam (sliced beef and brisket...pho) and Com Suon Cha Trung (grilled pork chop rice, egg and pork cake).  For sides, we ordered Nem Nuong (mammaâ__s lucky meatball), Canh Ga Chien Nuoc Mam (Viet wings) and Bo Nuong Xa (grilled lemongrass beef sticks).  We also ordered Ca Phe Phin Sua Nong (hot Viet coffee with milk). 

The food arrived quickly.  The beef pho was simply delicious and we finished everything including the soup. The chicken wings were crispy and very tasty, and so are the beef sticks.  The eatery is interestingly decorated, and we did not experience any staff who was disinterested or rude. On the contrary, the wait staff enquired whether we were attended to and also explained the condiments when our orders arrived.  Prices have gone up but the food is indeed tasty.More,The beef pho comes in a delicious broth with sufficient beef slices and pho. The appetizers or sides (such as the prawn skewer) were tiny and could be bigger given the prices. The ambience at the Beach Road outlet is more striking as it mimics...a hole-in-the-wall street eatery with Vietnamese music playing.More,Arrived early at midday but place was already half full.  Small-ish menu but still plenty of choice.  I chose the special Pho which was great but also recommend the vietnamese wings and fresh spring rolls - all super tasty and very reasonable prices.,My personal favorite place to go for Vietnamese food! Not only are the food authentic, it is extremely delicious! To start off, the place is located in near golden mile complex although it may be slightly further to most people, in my opinion it's worth...the travelling time if you're craving a nice bowl of warm pho that's guaranteed to satisfy your tastes buds. Besides, the decoration of the place is aimed to replicate a little Hanoi within Singapore & the rustic appearance really brings out the vibe even more. My friends & family would often meet up at the place to have dinner, the great part about us going together is being able to try the variety of food in the menu but the cons would be dependent on how busy they are during the period due to the confined space resulting in limited seating areas. Alright let's just dive right into the food next! Of course, going to a Vietnamese place means having to order a bowl of Pho. As a beef lover, naturally I had to go with the beef option for my first try. Firstly, the soup had such an intense aroma that can be be smelled even a distance away (friend was just arriving) & the noodles were just the right texture, soft but not overcooked. Most importantly, the beef was incredible!! It was tender & full of flavor that had seeped into the broth of the soup within the short duration because I couldn't help but slurp everything up. My friend had the chicken version & she said it was incredible too! The pork meatballs are also a must order, these are handmade with painstaking effort packed with immense flavour that goes really well with a sip of soup too! All in all, they're pretty affordable & a good thing to note beforehand is that they only accept cash so make sure to go prepared because we weren't. What's worse is that there wasn't any ATM available in the area so we didn't manage to withdraw cash & had to gather all the cash we had in our pockets. We actually didn't have enough for the exact amount so we were counting & compiling all our coins as well because we were still a little short on the total amount. Thankfully, the boss was really kind to us throughout and at the end decided to only take  our notes & even told us to keep the coins. We were so grateful!! Will always go back for more & recommend all my friends to give them a shot when visiting Singapore too!More,Walked past this shop for a couple of times and I finally decided to drop by to give their food a shot. Ordered the Beef Pho as well as their spring rolls. The beef Pho was good, portion was sufficient to make me full, just...that I find that the broth is a little more to the salty end, and I find that I was really thirsty after my lunch over there. 

As for the spring roll, surprisingly it is more to the crispy soft end, and the meat was really well marinated. I really like the texture of the spring roll as a whole and I think it is worth ordering.

However, overall I feel that service wise, the staff appears to be nonchalant about serving customers in general which made me feel unwelcome. Recommendations made by them is more like a FYI with no particular reasons on why is it good or not. Price wise, I think not really value for money.

Hope they can work on their service, and maybe go easier on the richness of the soup broth.More,Valuable price and delicious Vietnamese food, itâ__s my favorite place! But only can pay cash, no credit card service,I always come here for the bun cha and clams. Food is great but the place is quite cramped. Service is pretty decent, considering peak hour crowds.",The robot that served us made my sisters birthday special.,
"This restaurant boasts a robot that serves out your orders, and fun for you to re-enact yourselves as Teppanyaki chefs. Basically, you get to cook up a storm on your own personal iron griddle. Great cuts of meat yes, friendly staffs, all smiles, very polite...and attentive. HOWEVERâ_¦.  now, the keyword is Teppanyaki, the key ingredients are soy sauce and Mirin. Guess what, none of those are provided on our table for cooking. This restaurant is an insult to Japanese food. And I wonder if the customers that come here do realize they are not having real Teppanyaki here.More",The staff were missing humanity and working like robots.,
"Suffer from anxiety? Claustrophobia? Epilepsy? Autism? You might need to give this one a miss. If not- this is a must do, just because it is pretty extraordinary an experience that is so out there. 
The passage to the room where the show is actually...held is down a few flights of stairs and every single bit of visible surface area is covered in lights, sparkles, patterns, strobes or something gaudy and with music flooding your ears. It's pretty mind blowing. Then you sit in your spot and can't leave while the show is on. The show is right there, almost on your lap. And it is amazing. Sensory overload. Lights, dancing, robots, music, laser beams, creatures, motorised THiNgS, a bouncing horse, a man eating shark... Thankfully it doesn't go for too long. 
Best to eat before or after- food is average fried/junky stuff.More", The only highlight was watching the robot server cart go by.,
"Food is good and has options for everyone.  The player area was clean and the kids have asked over and over again, ""when are we going back toe Chuck E Cheese we had so much fun."",Staff was helpful. Needed to be a bit cleaner, but staff was nice. Machines all worked and that's unheard of. Something fun to do for an hour while on vacation. Best cheese stuffed sticks ever! Fresh made.,This day was the best and i  loved it so much that we just to go agin so today is the day that as a family we will go to this super super super copper place and we will go for the hole day and...get as many things as possible and ride the tallest rides and have the most fun i will have in my live so i can not what this is the best day ever and i will never forget it no matter what happens i will love it so much.More,We stayed across the street at the hotel from this chucky cheese. 

 You don't come to this type of establishment for pizza dislike you don't go to a movie expecting quality food..  It's a no brainer people.  The salad bar is a step up though....So me in the girls just walked across to this location.

 I can tell you that we've been to a few chucky in South Florida..  This location with way better!!  Much bigger much cleaner much brighter and much newer games! ""Paw patrol""

 If your child chooses to play the games that redeem tickets you will go through your money faster.

We spent $20 on tokens and was there for over 2 hours. 

 But if your child is under the age of say 4 you can stretch $10 for 2 hours plus as well on the younger rides..  Tons of photo Ops chucky was super nice! 

 Like any amusement situation you can easily go overboard and spend way too much money needlessly... but if you plan ahead you can have a pretty good time. on a budget.

Spent 32$ total.  3pm-6pmMore,I was there today with my grand kids, ages 3 & 5. They had fun playing the games but the rewards sucked. I can get better prizes from Dollar tree a lot cheaper. The food wasn't worth the money. The all you can eat salad...bar is very very sad and the kids chicken nuggets were over cooked and no flavor. The only perk was the staff was very nice and attentive. Next time I will take the kids to a local arcade and save money.More,The only reason I have it a 2 star is because my daughter loves this place and it always makes her excited.  Other than that,  there is no reason to even consider this place.  My most recent experience with specifically this location was poor. I...paid almost $50 For $10 in game tokens and 4 drinks and four buffets. The buffet was average at best and extremely limited.  The buffet was to last until 2pm, however they refused to make any more pizza 20 minutes before time was up. The pizza ran out and they would not make anymore; I felt jipped.More,You need to eat the pizza while it's hot, otherwise it's just nasty cardboard tasting pizza.   The salad bar needs to have a few more items and make sure the greens are fresh.,My family stopped at this Chucky E Cheese's as it is right off exit 180 on I-95 and a great mid-way point between north & south Florida.   The staff was all super helpful and great with the kids.  This is a new location so it's...clean (compared to other locations I've been to) and all the games are newer.   There are lots of windows and it's bright inside unlike other locations we have been too.   I like Chuck E Cheese compared to other arcades because almost all the games are one token.   So when you put $20 on a play card it last a long time, unlike other place we go $20 last 15 minutes.   They also don't charge you for a game card like others do.   Pizza, wings and salad bar were all above average and better than I expected.   My kid had a blast and I did as well since I left the building spending under $50.  We will stop again some dayMore,Our local Melbourne, Florida Chuck E Cheese has had some changes recently and new ""buffet"" lacks everything a buffet should be. When you think of buffet style pizza, you think of lots of choices of pizza and plentiful pizzas to load up your plate. But...this poor place had just 4 pizzas out at a time and they were gone so fast we had to wait 5-10 minutes on several occasions to get even a slice or two...even if they weren't the slice we wanted. You might be better off ordering an entire pizza for your table. But if you're family is like mine, agreeing on one type of pizza is impossible, which is why we chose the buffet to start with. 
In fairness, they did switch to card pass and got rid of the tokens, which is a HUGE plus.More,I like to come here because it makes the family happy.   They have a good time as we get to spend it together

For me also I think the pizza actually tastes pretty good

We don't spend too much but try to make it enjoyable...A good dayMore,Terrific security.   Safe place to bring children.   The children always have fun - playing games, running around, picking out prizes, singing with Chuck E, etc.   Dropped $60 for tokens, one large pizza (12 slices), two sodas, one coffee and two cotton-candy sticks.   Unbelievable the prices...charged.   The pizza was pretty good.   An expensive but enjoyable afternoon with the children.More,The largest I've been in. The kids had fun and so did I. I maybe had a little more fun. It was clean and kept the kids busy. Always a good choice. I get coupons offline to save money.,We've been there a couple of times and always have a good time.   A few days ago I went as part of a fundraiser for school and it's very good for both sides!   Kids get 10 tokens free and school gets 15% in funding. 
The...pizza is good, although I little on the price side.    This facility has lots of games, and very good service/servers.   I will definitely return.More,Games were okay (some very dated), prices for food were a bit steep. The pizza was decent but small. We were still hungry. My son is only 17 months old, but I'm sure he'll love it when he gets a little older. I will say...the package deals give you a lot of tokens to play with, and each game is only 1 token per play, which was nice. 

Biggest feedback I could give would be to get some more updated games...or at least some classic vintage ones. A handful of the ones on the floor are worn to the point of not being playable anymore.More,held a birthday party here for my nieces. wow they did an awesome job pulling off a memorable party, playing games even the grown ups including me had a hoot. also serve beer which is a plus. nothing like feeling like a kid again and...forgetting all the stress. the pizza was not greasy or oily totally yummy. would recommend doing a party there or just hanging out with family or friends.More","The use of robot-waiters has been the trend of the owner using it more frequently in the restaurants. Also a very cute little robot to bring u some starters ;),Fairly soulless experience with little to recommend it for.",
"We booked the degustation menu and were guided through a 4.5 hours dinner. Some of the dishes were very smart and a real poem but there very some courses which we really did not understand and did not enjoy so much. The 14 months cured...beef with the beef fat was just way too intense for our taste. Also the duck and the wagyu courses were to intense for us. For our taste, some courses focussed also to much on fancy chic chic products instead of focussing on the experience and taste. What we found the most fascinating dishes were the appetizers at the counter and the mexican dessert. These we will definitely not forget! 
So in total it was ok, but we would not come here again.More,Looks like Jordi Cruz has done it again fabulous restaurant but just acquired second star and I can see a third one coming
Exquisite attention to detail
Fabulous food and great wine pairings
Much better than the three star Lesarte that we also visited 
And...significantly less costMore,Had a lovely experience last night. Everything was top notch - the staff, the food, the wine pairing. We were there in a group of 3 - a couple and a 13 year old. Stuff was not only very professional, but also very friendly and...engaging towards the little one.

Itâ__s tough to point out a particular highlight of the dinner as everything was interesting and delicious, butâ_¦ the shrimp was just wow - never ate one prepared so good.

It was a very lovely evening.
Thanks for hosting us.
Definitely worth experiencing.More,Even, I told restaurant via email in advance that i dont eat beef and allergic to shrimp and lobster.
They acknowledged this when I arrived at resto.

The restaurant served me wagyu and black garlic. When I asked for first replacement, they just took Wagyu...out and served me the pure black garlic. When I complained, they replaced me with tasteless monkfish. 

The next plate was aged steak tatar in which they replaced me with cheese wraped in vegetable(see photo). I dont know how they get two stars given the taste and very bad management both in the kitchen and frontline.

Date of booking: 8.15 PM - 23 Aug 2022.More,We had looked forward to visiting Angle for our honeymoon. And even if they donâ__t reccomend bringing kids under 8 years they allow it and have no plan for correcting the ambience for the other guests when it sadly results in disturbance and crying from...a baby brought to the meal. 

The most disappointing thing was the shoulder shrug in the beginning of the meal saying that there was nothing to be done, even if this would ruin our and other patrons experience. They did not even try to correct the situation or compensate in the end, not so much as a free coffe was offeredâ_¦ 

A real shame that the leadership at the restaurant fails, they havenâ__t even responded to my e-mail after the dinner. Because the waiter was good, the food was great and the sommelier was awesome! 

However, the lack of service, problem solving skills and customer follow up from the senior management makes this a disappointing 2 star experience for us, & thatâ__s not worthy of a 2 star Michelin restaurant that charges 650 euro per couple.More,We had an entirely enjoyable experience here. Food is inventive and interesting. Hard to place the cuisine. Clear French influence, in the basic approach, but doesnâ__t stop there. Good balance between rich and fresh in the palate. Wine pairing v good, jus the right amount...of surprise

Price of ~580 Eur for two of course bot cheap, but much less than comparable in Copenhagen.More,The food absolutely breathtaking, wine list as expected very good, service very professional , with top English and nice explanation of the served food.,The first time we went to Angle years ago they still had only one Michelin star and we knew they deserved more!! 

The food was very tasty and of high quality. Dishes are very colorful and good-looking, we all enjoyed a lot, definitely a excellent...culinary experience. 

The service was very good and the staff were friendly.More,Excellent lunch and we were surprized that the restaurant was not very busy. 

A glass of cava and amuse bouche is served in the lobby which is OK if there are not too many people but maybe if you have several tables coming in the...same time, it can feel crowded as the restaurant has 13 tables.

Food presentation, flavors and service were all excellent!

We had the tasting-menu with wine-pairing and they were complementing each other very well. In spite of having nine courses, we were not uncomfortable when leaving the restaurant.

Try it, if you get a table.

We would love to go back again.More,Angle has imaginative and delicious food with a beautiful room and fantastic service.   It is expected to be amazing when a restaurant has two or more Michelin stars, but Angle does not disappoint.  The courses just kept coming, one perfect taste after another.  The wine...pairings matched so week and did not hold back on volume.  Some favorite dishes were Fois Gras Tacos, Peas in Cream, Mackerel, and the bread and butter was even a standout.   Canâ__t miss dining in Barcelona!More,Fantastic restaurant! Everything was perfect, the food, the service and the restaurant decor. The mackerel, the tacos and the steak tartar were the highligts of the night. 
Wine pairing was perfect.
Highly recomended.,Renovation of the place is just ok, atmosphere is just above average , service is can say is 5/10, a waiter even broke a bottle of water right in front of me and broken glasses is everywhere. Letâ__s get back to the food, 
The chef...tried to use local ingredients to mimic a japanese cuisine using raw seafood for all dishes but with a twist of Barcelona taste. 
It does not appear of what the chef try to achieves, I am an asian, it is tooooooo salty for us , everything is just too salty and overpowering the ingredient itself 
It taste like amateur chef cooking 
So disappointed and the dinner served until 12.30am, (start at 8.30pm) which is tooooo slow, it took us 4 hours of waiting and finishing the whole course. We are the last table 

So disappointed for a 2 star Michelin restaurantMore,I had an amazing experience. The waiters were so sweet, nice and professional. The food was like an art show. Our waiter, Andrea, spoke to us warmly and was so professional. We loved our experience. Thank you for making my 7 year anniversary with my...boyfriend special.More,We had a lovely evening at Angle (one of Jordi Cruz' restaurants).
We have tried ABaC before and that was fantastic.
Angle is also amazing ... food and wine wise.
Service is not up to normal standard for a Michelin place.
It felt to me...like the staff didn't feel at home and really didn't wanted to be there.
Not a 2 star Michelin place worthy ...More,Made reservations here 2-3 months in advance with high expectations for a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Specifically noted dietary restrictions for my wife who is pescatarian. First thing that felt off was they do not reply to emails. Sure enough when we arrived, they served...my wife a foie gras taco even after I reconfirmed prior to start of the meal. They took it back and replaced it with an unseasoned AVOCADO taco. Then they replaced an Iberian ham fritter with a plain vegetable fritter. The kitchen clearly DID NOT prepare any replacement dishes for the dietary restriction and simply made the same dishes with CHEAP ingredients. It was not until we made a comment that they finally replaced a squab dish with turbot which was little too late. 

Overall the food was mediocre at best. Clams were clearly not fresh and had a bad aftertaste. Squab was overcooked. Lots of dishes were bland. Opening ceviche dish was far too sour and masked all flavor of mackerel. 

The worst part was the service. Never did they ask how the dishes were. They didnâ__t apologize for mistakes. Water glasses were always empty. Despite using cheap ingredients for dishes they didnâ__t plan in advance, they had the gall to charge full price saying avocado dishes cost as much as foie gras. I asked for the waiters name to speak to the manager and he refused. This is not even close to Michelin level service. 

DO NOT EAT HERE. Eat at LaSarte, Hermanos Torres, Uma or Disfrutar instead. Iâ__ve eaten at all those places and the service has been impeccable. This was McDonalds quality service.More",They even have a robot that delivers hot dishes straight to your table. They had the robot waiter too which beat the server to the table.,
"Service and food were superb. Chef came out and spoke to us and gave us a jar of a spread he created that day because one of our friends loved it so much! Great lunch!,Donâ__t botherâ_¦ Checked reviews on Google after our experience and they also donâ__t have much to say for this place but we ended up there by default before we had checked reviews. Avoid if youâ__ve got a choice! 
Weâ__ve been in Italy for over 2...weeks now and never had a bad meal or had to send anything back- I guess this was the one!
Ravioli was bland and plain - you can get better pre-packed ravioli in a supermarket.
Ribolitta soup was SO salty, we had to send it back TWICE and then we got shouted at by the lady at the counter! 

Donâ__t botherâ_¦ too many other much nicer and better quality restaurants in the area.More,No negative reflections on the service, however the food was less than subpar. We chose this place as all others were closed for a midday break. This should have been our clue. In the country where each establishment serving food take a great pride at...excelling and proving Italian cooking is indeed smth to write home about, this place will in the very least underdeliver. It all honesty, the quality of food served is offensive. The nuts in the salad were stale, the pasta over cooked w mushrooms that vaguely resembled a vegetable substance without any flavour. I would have left it at that and blamed it on self for not checking the reviews prior to ordering, but the last touch was the â__cash outâ__ station at the bar. You can not pay at the table, you have to go inside where the female behind the bar will not acknowledge your presence, so you essentially stand there waiting at The mercy of her attention. Waste of time. But the 4 mins for this review will help you not to waste yours.More,Stay away. Only busy because it is open while other restaurants are closed.This is bad Italian food, period, but even worse in Tuscany. We were hungry and all other restaurants were closed- we unfortunately paid the price with very bad food. Donâ__t go.,What a negative experience. The loaction of the restaurant and facilities are very nice. But food is mediocre at best. We can get much better pizza in our localnin Hong Kong. 

Worst is the so called service. Waiters fighting with each other. 

Getting bill paid...is another struggle. 

Please avoid this place.More,Rating in the court yard is without doubt lovely, however, after that the service was poor.  The worst thing for me was ordering a bottle of red wine & it came out hot!! I didnâ__t want mulled wine but thatâ__s what it was like. I...asked for some ice in a bucketâ_¦ no canâ__t do that!! This is Italy where I thought the locals prided themselves on wine. The food was ok. My medium steak was well done. I would not come back. Oh and they totally forgot the salad we ordered but happily billed me for itâ_¦ Clearly I refused that part of the payment.More,Bad service, dishes came not at the same time, pasta bad quality, one dish came late after reclamation it was delivered cold.,The setting of this restaurant is very nice, and we had very attentive and considerate service for lunch.   In our experience we found the wine list was not as good as we would have expected in this city of fine wine.  The food was very...average, and for the cost, a bit disappointing.More,Just terrible. Slow service, food cold when it finally arrived, tasteless, so very disappointing for what looks like a lovely place. Donâ__t go!!,Poor quality (salads, cheese, bruschette, pasta). Everything we ordered was disappointing. Would not recommend at a_ºl.,I was visiting with friends and we walked in here for lunch because the courtyard looking interesting and was out of the sun.

The service was excellent, but the food was average.  Of the 3 of us having lunch, only the person who ordered the...margherita pizza was happy with their food.

We found the food pricey for what we received.  I would not stop in here, again.More,I was visiting Montepulciano with friends and we stopped in here for lunch.  The location was lovely and the restaurant looked very interesting.

The service was fine, the food was quite average.  One of my friends and I ordered a ""pizza"" with arugula and ham...and this what we received - arugula and ham on cooked pizza dough.  No cheese or tomato sauce - dry and disappointing.   To be fair, another friend ordered a margherita pizza.  The margherita pizza looked very nice and my friend indicated the margherita pizza was fine.

The price was high for arugula and ham on dough.   I would not stop in this established again.More,Beautiful outdoors atmosphere and it ends there. There were three of us dining and a toddler and we were served exactly three slices of dry bread and three packets of tasteless olive oil in  a outdoor restaurant was surrounded by olive trees in the middle...Montepulciano, Italy renowned for Italian food and olive oil.  At this point I felt as if I was on a airplane with the packets of olive oil.  We were charged 10% for  the table cover charge called Coperto, but the table was covered with   with paper placemats.
We order bruschetta  to share called Fantasia di Crostini with different toppings. The bruschetta was cut in half to share. It was cold and soggy the 3 of us including the Italian baby didn't  finish a small half slices of the bruschetta.  Insalata Mista which was the salad this was a small plate of nondescripted lettuce and 3 thinly slice tomatoes no mix lettuce.

The Ravioli tasted like bad Instant-Ravioli with Instant-tomato sauce. The Tagliatelle tasted like not salted noodles with bitter zucchini. The parmesan cheese for topping came in small plastic packages - so you can imagine how fresh all other ingredients were. The...waiter seemed confused at first, but later we could clearly smell the alcoholic sent coming from his mouth.
Would definitely not recommend going there.More,We spontaneously ended up at this restaurant to get some lunch. We were sitting outside and the waiter was very attentive and super friendly. He seemed to be the only waiter around and had his hands full and sometimes a bit trouble to keep up....There was a big group there at the same time, so we had to wait a little while until he took our order. But he always kept a smile on, even though there was definitely enough work for too. He didn't speak very good English, but definitely enough to be able to serve us. We didn't had to wait all that long for our food to arrive and it was very tasty. The only unusual thing was, that both our gnocchi where still a bit doughy, not like I know gnocchi, but we actually liked it. For the payment you had to go inside to pay at the cash desk. Unusual but no big deal and at least something that was taken off that hard working waiters hands!More",None,
"Like most Sushi restaurants, we go for the quality and the variety of food, but do not expect to receive any more than 2 stars service, although they charge a 5 stars prices.
However the ambiance is really nice and luxurious, and the most funny...part that you are served by both humans and real robots.. however some humans act as robots as well.
If any one can find a sushi restaurant where they smile to you, treat you nicely and don't throw the food on your table, then please name it to me, instead of receiving the free soup from shelters service.More,Hi there - thank you for the feedback Emad! As I mentioned in our private messages, this feedback is great for our team to hear. I'll be following up with them and seeing how we can do better.

Thanks again.

Ryan,On a recent take-out order, the food was disappointingly bland and quite average. Also, not much like true Japanese or Thai cuisine. It does have a nice ambiance inside and is a better option for quality of meat than other Chinese, err... I mean ""Thai""...places nearby.More,Hi there Trolt,

Thank you very much for your feedback! I'll be sure to pass it on to the team. If you could send me an email at Ryan@WindGroupInc.com so I can get a bit more detail from you, I would appreciate it!

Thanks again!...More,We have been to The Wind many times and enjoyed each occasion - food, service and atmosphere and of course the robots who deliver the food to the tables.   Compared to other restaurants, we have found Wind very safe during this pandemic, following health protocols...and making sure their guests feel relaxed and comfortable.  The partitions between each table also give a sense of privacy which is nice.  We would definitely recommend going to this restaurant.More,Hi Diane, thank you so much for this extensive and wonderful review! We are honoured to be considered one of the safest spots to visit during the pandemic and will share this with our team as a recognition for their hard work :)

I mentioned the reservation, and he just pointed inside and said: ""don't you see we are busy! does not matter you made a reservation"". I did not leave,...just because I was waiting for other family members to arrive. After a lot of discussions, we got a table inside the way we required. The service inside was good. I missed: red tuna, tobiko, and fried banana (dessert). I will definitely do not come back. I would prefer August 8 instead.More,Hello Claudio, thank you for reaching out. We investigated your visit with our team, and after many inquiries, we found that when the manager took your reservation for 10 people, he indicated that he couldn't guarantee a table on the patio because of the big...More,The food was very good and so was the service.

We are sorry that your experience at Wind Mississauga didnâ__t quite match your expectations. We would love to know why so that we can deliver a better experience next time. You may reach us anytime at wecare@windgroupinc.com.
We...More,This restaurant has been our favorite restaurant in Mississauga for past few years.

Tonight we were swarmed with fruit flies on our food and our table. We looked at the other tables and there were plenty of the same fruit flies.

We pointed this out...to the waitress, who apologized, but we did not see her talk to the manager after our talk.  I got the impression that manager on duty is probably aware of the problem.

I hope this problem is resolved, because we both love this restaurant and would hate to think this is not a anomaly.   Someone working there probably screwed up and did not remember to throw out the trash.

The fact that there were flies all over our table and tables adjoining ours lead me to believe that kitchen is probably in no better condition.

I hope we do not get sick from dining here.

I hope things get better at the Wind, as it has been a good restaurant over the years.More,Dear Boba, thank you for letting us know about this. 
All of our restaurants have periodical disinfect visits from regulatory pest control specialists, so we will investigate this irregularity with Management to resolve it promptly and accurately.
We apologize your visit wasn't satisfactory. Please feel...More,first of all, i like wind japanesse sushi overall, better than other sushi of same pricce range in GTA lihe 168, especially wind japanesse sushi in Lundy lane in Niagara. But the store in mississauga does not in the same level of food and service...as the one in niagara. the Niagara place has the seabass grilled that I and my colleagues absolutely love, but mississauag does not have, although same price.    
yesterday, we went to all you can eat for dinner for six people , when give me the bill to pay, the server has already add 17% service fee on top of the bill : (6x35)+ 27.3( 13% HST) + 35.51$ service fee (17%). 
Off course we give tip, but the service is ok, nothing special, and normally we will add 15% or more to the service as coutesy for the waiter/waitress but to me it seems rude and annoyed to add service fee higher than standard, without asking the permission. 
do not know if it is the general rule apply to all customers at Wind or not.More,very rude service.  people who are not polite or professional.  it is to be avoided.

unpleasant service,First and foremost, I absolutely love all the Wind Restaurants and East Izakaya so much, that I always recommend it to visitors up in Niagara/St. Catharines area. Each Wind location offers a little twist of their own which is nice as a loyal customer to...have different experiences at each location. I love that the Mississauga location has the twist of the Brazilian Steakhouse on top of the all you can eat Japanese.  Now with the Covid situation, I still like to order take out for my family.  I am very disappointed with the management/host at this location as he can sometimes come off as rude and condescending. I have overlooked this in the past whenever we would dine in, as this place has a lovely atmosphere, great presentation and hard working servers. The last straw was the time I tried to order take out, and I could not even get a special request put into place that other competitive sushi places have accommodated. I will make sure to avoid this place from now on which is very unfortunate as my extended family and I were loyal customers.More,This is a typical Eat All You Can Sushi Japanese restaurant where you order via a tablet.
 The only difference with other Japanese restaurants we have dined in is that the presentation of the food is excellent. The food is very well presented, fresh and...therefore does not only look good but taste good too.
 The buffet menu is quite extensive with a lot of options for both sushi and Thai food.Service was greatMore,I was looking for a quality Sushi/Sashimi restaurant to take a client too.  This looked promising online but I didnâ__t realize it was a combination of all you can eat and al carte.  We ordered Al carte sushi sashimi platter and while the fish was...fresh I think the sushi chef was overcompensating with the size of the pieces of fish particularly with the sashimi - they we huge!  More pieces cut into smaller delicate pieces would have been a much better experience for me and my guest.  More authentic Japanese too.

As for customer service, I think they have a long way to go.More",This place has a robot! Did I mention they have a robot?,
"We arranged for delivery to our rental due to us being busy with work, they asked for a phone number which I provided but because I'm from the UK apparently the delivery drivers don't call you if they have an issue so they just cancelled...our order. Management did rectify this but it meant waiting longer and digging into our time. The food was okay but I wouldn't rush to eat there again.More,Absolutely delicious food, very quick delivery. Excellent vegetarian/vegan selection, and an extensive menu.,Went here cause the one on Ventura Blvd was good until it burnt down.  This one is just as good.  The hot and sour soup is excellent - a little spicy.  I also I had the beef with green beans.  The beans were crunchy and...could have been done a little more.  The beef was very tasty.  I seemed to taste it for a couple of hours but that maybe to by Nordic blood thinking ketchup is a spice.
Not crowded and good friendly wait staff.  I recommend it.More,We were walking up North Fairfax Avenue when we noticed this little Chinese restaurant to the right of us. It had been a busy day and ridiculously hot, so we decided to dine here. The restaurant seemed very appealing from the outside and had large...windows (We always like to look inside first to see if its busy). Upon entering we were greeted by a lovely server who took us to our table - I had the perfect view as I could see out on to the street to have a look around. I explained to the server that I haven't tried much Chinese food and usually stick to the same things. The server was amazing and gave recommendations of what I should try - I am so glad that she did as the food was lovely and the portions were massive. I would highly recommend this place as the service and food was lovely, and would return on my next visit.More,Me and my boyfriend recently went here having purchased a groupon. We weren't expecting much but ended up pleasantly surprised by this place.

I ordered the garlic chicken, and my boyfriend ordered some beef friend rice. It's safe to say that one main meal could...easily fill two people; they were huge! 

Very delicious food, in a very clean restaurant, with ample parking. Would definitely recommend if you're just looking for a cheap bite to eat.More,This place looked a bit more like a cafe than a restaurant so I wasn't sure what sort of food it would be. However I definitely should not have been worried. I think It was more of a locals restaurant as it didn't seem touristy,...I liked this though.   I can honestly say that it is probably the best Chinese restaurant I have eaten in.  The food was lovely and big portions.  We actually went back a second time it was so good.  The service was good too.More,Didnt feel like going out and got directed via DoorDash (not recommended, they dont answer the phone, changes difficult, delivery person not nice.) Issue with restaurant started when i called to add a drink. The girl who answered told me to call Door Dash, which...i had, but they didnt answer and they didnt answer for her. I had just spent $45 and she wasnt helpful at resolving a simple drink add on. She reluctantly added it. The food arrived an hour later hot, but no utensils or napkins. i called back and she left me on hold. The Mongolian beef was very good, juicy and tender. The combo fried rice was warm, bland and had not taste. Im being generous with an avg rating as the service absolutely sucked. Whether this person who answers is a relative or not, I wouldn't let her talk to my customers, ever!More,Had robot chicken and firecracker chicken, white and brown rice.
Food is below par as is the service.  Rice way over cooked and meals were drenched in cornstarch before frying.  Sauces were just ok.  Did love the generous red bell pepper in the firecracker chicken...which was much better than the robot chicken.
Will not return.More,We returned to Kung Pao and it didn't disappoint.  Friendly staff, plain but clean surroundings and food was delicious. We also had a cocktail each which was surprising to see on the menu somehow but very good.  We had Orange Chicken, Sweet & Sour Chicken...and Crispy Beef - all big portions and recommended.  Will return again as so convenient just next to Whole Foods on corner of Santa Monica Boulevard.More,Blown away by this place ! The staff and waiters are all very friendly, and the food is so delicious.  The orange chicken is truly delicious but the Pad Thai is like WOW 100% delicious.  I highly recommend that dish in particular.  Good prices for...huge portions.  Great place!More,I went firstly night to try the infamous Kung  Pao chicken made famous in Seinfeld. It was delicious.  I went back the next night too as it's close to my Airbnb. Chicken pad Thai was also great. May go back again too.,We ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet and Sour  Chicken and Beef and Broccoli and everything was very good. Good size portions and excellent service.,Looking for a decent, but fast meal in West Hollywood and we lucked into this place.  Prices are good and everything was great!  Does not disappoint!,The quality of food is wonderful and the staff is attentive and helpful. No pretense or attitude for the location. While the setting is not fancy it is definitely a winner.,My wife and I were working a night shift cleaning up an apt complex,  so we decided to order in.... so we called the food experts.... ordering on line was easy....but food for almost  $45 dollars, was bad,food was ok... but not enough....it looks like...it was for kids!! I could've gotten Chinese food for 40 people at China Express... no utensils plus late!
Chaoming..OK PLUS Shrimp noodles OK.
BUT SOUP VERY TASTELESS!! IF I WAS TO RATE THIS PLACE I WOULD GIVE IT A 4-More",Computerized ordering system used he runs around taking all the orders like a...robot except I think a robot would be polite!,
"We were staying in a hotel within walking distance of this restaurant. We were actually looking for a different place, but ""The Sakura"" looked nice, so we took a chance. 

The first thing the waiter did was ask me (in Japanese) if we had a...reservation. Although I can speak some Japanese, because he spoke in such a soft voice I could barely hear him. He then re-asked me in perfect English, which was nice, because usually no one will speak English to me in Japan unless they're at a high-end hotel or unless they are compelled to. 

We didn't have a reservation, and even though it was a Monday (or Tuesday) night, a lot of reservations had been made. Nonetheless, the waiter gave us a table. It was so dark that we couldn't see the menu. He actually removed a small decorative light from a different area and put it on our table, which really didn't make any sense. Finally we pointed to a well-lit table and he sat us there. (But why he didn't do that the first time is a mystery. 

The menu looked somewhat appetizing and the prices didn't seem too high. They had ""special seasonal drinks,"" and I ordered one (passionfruit/kiwi ""sparkling""). It was okay at best. I ordered a hamburger (which they were advertising in a poster outside the restaurant) and my husband ordered a more Japanese-style ""stamina"" steak dinner. 

Throughout the course of the evening, we were tended to by the waiter and sometimes a waitress, both who seemed to forget about us until we alerted them to our presence. They were polite and pretty, but they didn't seem to be paying that much attention. 

The food was delivered to us by a robot, which seemed bizarre, because the atmosphere of the restaurant, at first glance, seemed classy. But we soon realized that the number of staff was minimum, even though the dining space was quite large. 

I cannot say that anything we ate was impressive, nor were the drinks that special. I will say that the interior was clean and appealing, but ultimately it didn't make that much difference, because the staff didn't seem to be paying close attention to what was going on. That might have been because there were only a few of them and they were counting on the robot to take care of some of their duties. I do not think the robot made that much of a difference. 

So, thumbs up on appearance, and the waiter and waitress were both very attractive, and extra points for the waiter, since he spoke clear, beautiful English. But none of that matters if the food isn't great, and the food was ""acceptable."" I will not return.More,Stayed in the nearby Hilton and wanted to go out to eat but not venture back to the station area of town. Found this and a number of other restaurants in a precinct area not visible from street level, so easy to miss, but only...50 metres from the hotel. Restaurant has a varied menu and the quality of food was excellent with fab service to boot. Tried a variety of dishes but can highly recommend the beef steak. Restaurant has a nice ambiance and quite relaxing and staff are very attentive without being overbearing.More,The restaurant verieties of cuisine. European, Italian, German and Japanese.we live Japanese food, and are in Japan - so it was obvious to try their version for Japanese food.
It was good. We took the deal of fish + sashimi + shusi. Everything was great!,My first night in Tokyo - I went with my daughter and her one year old - staff was excellent. The Sakura dining had excellent food, well presented, soooo tasty and superb staff served in immaculate environment.  The waiter was attentive and the presentation beautiful....Everything tastes wonderful- Definitly recommend!More,One of the best steak places I have ever come across... hand on heart. The place is immaculately clean, the decor is traditional and subtle and the service courteous and professional. The best thing however us the food. I tried their Japanese beef and the...experience was excellent. The steak literally melts in your mouth. I also had their chocolate gateau with ice cream which was very nice too. Overall a very satisfactory experience. Will have no trouble highly recommending this place to fellow lovers of good steak.More,This restaurant is the best! We ate there for lunch and enjoyed it so much that we had our last dinner in Tokyo there! There's a lot of variety to choose from, and the chefs take great care in preparing your food. After your (free)...visit to the top of the Tokyo Met building, take a short walk to this place for lunch or dinner. Walk down the steps to the Shinjuku I-land tower patio, you'll see it on the bottom level. I wouldn't recommend eating outside though - too many smokers.More,I had a pleasant time having dinner with my friends.  It was not really a formal place but still can have relaxing time with friends.   Yona yona draft beer was really good.  The variety of Japanese style food was excellent.  A little bit expensive but...worth the quality and atmosphere.More,Our family of 3 recently spent 6 nights at the Hilton Tokyo hotel in Shinjuku where we found this restaurant by chance.  The waiting staff were very accommodating and friendly and the food was absolutely beautiful. We were so pleased with the quality and variety...of food offered on their menu we dined at this restaurant 3 nights of the 6 nights we spent in Shinjuku. Excellent value for money and reasonably priced.More,Caught a quick lunch here with colleagues and was impressed with the limited menu.  Few choices, but all well done.  I hadn't had a hamburger in over a month, so I took a chance on my first Japanese hamburger and was impressed. Staff was very...attentive even with a packed house.More,The rain made us look for a restaurant close to the Hilton and TripAdvisor came up trumps! Started with cocktails and a laugh as we both wanted vodka martini rather than gin. The barman brought the bottles to the table to explain the contents and...check our wishes. Cocktails excellent! We both then ordered set menus but different ones. Same starter plate different mains and dessert with mine - all superb.
During the meal I had been watching a very elegant Japanese couple in the corner getting a lot of attention. As they were leaving the gentleman nodded to us and our waitress appeared with coffee for us both - a gift from him! And then she got even more excited as she told us he was coming over! He was interested that we were the only Western customers that night and had noticed we were having some fun with the staff. He was pleased we were enjoying our experience â_º. 
We left on a high - excellent food, great staff and a special moment!More,I had great sushi style dinner over the past days in Tokyo but tonight on my own I needed something substantial. Being a Viking from Denmark I love my pork and Sakura offered a great loin steak and it was tender and succulent. It came...as part of a set dinner set and with the bottle of South African Cabernet Sauvignon it came to $50 one third of what I normally would have paid in Sydney or Singapore. Japan I love you!More,No title, food was good, however the wait time between appetizer, salad and the meal was just to long.  Service was bad, though we looked at what appeared to be the floor manager we were just ignored.,Located in the I-land building. You can walk there in 2 minutes from the Hilton or Hyatt Cross the road. 
We were attracted to some teriyaki and suriyaki dishes presented outside, but they were not on the menu. After asking we received another menu with...these items. For around 3,000 yen not to cheap, not too expensive. Fantastic presentation on a large plate with many small additional dishes and miso soup. The suriyaki came in a iron cast plate on a burner, tasted like shabu shabu!
Staff was not to good in english, but enough to communicate the basics. Both teriyaki and sukiyaki tasted fantastic, so a great alternative to expensive hotel dining. You can even walk there underground, so leave your umbrella at home.More,We found this restaurant by mistake and it turned out to be our favourite meal from our entire Japanese holiday! 

Food was absolutely delicious, staff were very friendly, helpful and accomodating. Superb Sake as recommended by our waiter and an overall amazing experience. Menu was...written in English and Japanese which made life much easier for me (I have food allergies so I need to know what I am eating!) 

Worth a visit and I will definitely eat there again next time I am in Tokyo!More,While in tokyo we ate at this resturant three times. We had a mix of Japanese and western dishes and all were excellent. I really liked the hamburger, excellent! I also had the salt grilled hamachi, and boiled turnip greens, very tasty. The service can...be spotty, but I would still recommend this place. It's next to the Hilton and across from the Hyatt. Try the American lemonade cocktail, it's really sangria.More",None,
"I happened to find myself in Saint Paul, but only had 20 minutes for lunch before heading back to Minneapolis. I could've done take away, but took a chance with dine in.

I ordered from their lunch special menu. All the lunch entrees are served...with chicken fried rice and, for an additional charge, could be supplemented with a soup or pork egg roll.
I didn't have to wait too long for my meal to arrive and that includes the travel time for this absolutely adorable cat robot to deliver my meal from the kitchen to the dining room.

There are two of these robots: one is in the dining room and I deduced the other was in the kitchen. When I placed my order, I was allowed to seat myself and, when my meal was being brought out (and the cats switched places) its display showed my table number.
Bonus: the food was hot but the plate was warm, meaning I could easily reach in and collect it myself with no danger of hurting myself. I'm assuming the robots are a safety measure in light of the pandemic, just like the shields at the front counter.

All in all, I was able to enjoy my meal thoroughly, without rushing and made my bus home, which stopped out front at the corner, with two minutes to spare.

Kudos to New Fresh Wok for their great service, quick cook and delicious food.More,This restaurant features a lunch menu that is really, really, really good. Add to that a great price and absolutely consistant quality and you have the reason it is our ""go to"" lunch spot. They make their own wontons for the Wonton soup! Generous servings...as well! We have been coming to this restaurant for years.More,We ordered dinner from here last week and the food was ready when we got there.  The food was great so we will be going there again.,This was handy and good. A recent selection of vegetarian and vegan options. Reasonably priced for the volume. Easy two meal servings.,A friend of mine and me decided to go here for lunch. It is located at the east end of a small strip mall in the NE quadrant of Snelling Ave. & Larpentuer in Falcon Heights. We arrived right at 11 am, were seated right...away and ordered. I had the moo goo gai pan lunch special, which was under six dollars and my friend had the won ton soup. It was served very hot and tasty.  The restaurant was nicely appointed, very clean and staff very attentive.  We would return here again and prices were very reasonable.More,Food was excellent and service was great!

We had a to go order which we waited in the restaurant for and food came out fast and hot!,The food here is very good, but it is just not to my taste.  I prefer the ""firm"" tofu over the ""silken,"" and I like ""whole,"" ""hot"" chilis in my Szechuan; not pepper flakes.  But, I do understand that restaurants adjust their menus to suit...the tastes in their demographic, and I suppose people in the area like theirs that way.  

The prices and portion sizes were about what I would expect - very generous - as they are at most Chinese-Style restaurants.  Everything was cooked and seasoned as I would expect, but just slightly adjusted according to the different chef.  For example, we had the Vegetable and Bean Curd Soup for two.  The broth used was different from what we were used to, but still very good.  Also, the vegetables added were different, too, but still tasty.  It's just a regional variation from a different cook.  Even though it is different, you can still get a good meal at a good price here.  

I liked that this restaurant also offered sushi, and other Japanese menu items as well.  These days, many restaurants expand their menus this way to appeal to more customers.  I can see this restaurant being very popular with locals, even though it wasn't my favorite.  They aren't there to appeal to my singular tastes, but, if they were, I would ask that they use more of the ""firm"" tofu, and make their spicy dishes actually spicy.  The spicy here was not spicy in the slightest to my tastes.More,Had some sushi and three different stir fry dishes for lunch with the family. Everything and fresh and delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Going back soon.,I hit this place up for lunch a fair amount of the time since I work nearby but also because their lunch special is absurdly cheap and much more delicious than you might expect. At just under 6 bucks, there are about 12 -15 or...so available dishes, and each one includes some tasty fried rice. I tend to always get the same thing (Hot and Spicy Beef) but I have introduced some co-workers to this place and everyone ends up loving it. Service, even if busy, is fast, the food always comes out hot, and while the interior won't dazzle you, it feels homey and the servers and hostess are always welcoming. I have never come here for dinner, so can't comment on the ""full menu,"" but if it's as good as their lunch specials, I imagine it's all fantastic.More,I had house wonton soup and buffalo wings. My dinner partner had sesame chicken.

The wings were crispy, hot, and delicious. I would definitely have them again.

The wonton soup was bland in that it needed salt. It had shrimp, mushrooms, pea pods, bokchoy, and...wontons. 

The sesame chicken dinner was 8.25 and included an egg roll and chicken fried rice. Two thumbs up for freshness and flavor.More,I had sesame chicken and it was so fresh and tender, I feel like I've always been served old tired chickens from other Chinese restaurants my entire life.

My husband's food came long before the rest of us, he was halfway finished before we got...served.  It was a table of 3 not 30, shouldn't have been hard to co-ordinate serving us at the same time.More,Local Chinese Friends took me to this place.  Went on a Sunday afternoon.  This is a place that they LOVE TO GO TO.  The staff was friendly.  The portions seemed large.  Did not try the Sushi.  

The place has the feel of a family atmosphere....And has the feeling also of an old lunch diner also.   I think this is perhaps why my friends like to often go there.  The food is perhaps more Chinese Style than being Americanized.  

If I go to visit my friends.  I am sure I will see this place again.

The correct address should be 1533 Larpenteur AveMore,The cafe's name does summarize it's food. I often have the chicken and mixed vegetables menu item which comes with an egg role. Cost is very reasonable at $8. The food arrives shortly after ordering and is consistently hot with crisp wok cooked veges and...grilled chicken pieces. I consider it a wonderful neighborhood staple.More,This our favorite place for Chinese food. The portions are generous and very tasty. You get a meal at a very reasonable price. It is a clean restaurant.  I always get General Tso's chicken and have never finished it, so have a meal the next...day at home.More,From the outside, you would not expect such a charming restaurant. The inside is tastefully decorated and clean. Great atmosphere! Generous portions for a decent price! I got a dinner special and an order of wontons for $13. Our server was helpful and very friendly....I really enjoyed this restaurant and will be back! Highly highly recommend!!More"," I was personally impressed by the robot too, although our table wasn't served by it.",
"Stale chips, wrong order, quesadillas used to be great now missing ingredients - this is my first negative review because anyone can have a bad day yet - there needs to be some Area Managers to up the standards here.,I purposely waited 12 hours prior to posting this to ""gain perspective"".  So I'll merely lay out the facts.  I ordered a Steak Burrito online from Chipotle through their ""Guac Zone"" app. (note: this does not get you free Quac immediately).  Ordered at 5:34 P.M....and arrived for the order at 5:46 P.M.  It was not ready and the front line knew nothing about it.  After checking the back kitchen the counterperson emerged from the back kitchen with my bag.  At this point I had decided to eat-in restaurant and opened my bag.  The Steak Burrito was cold.  I don't mean a ""lack of heat"", it was cold.  I presented the cold burrito to the counterperson thinking they would surely remake it on the spot.  That would have been ""pride in the product"" and ""concern for the customer"".  No such luck, as the three counterpersons stood there with blank looks claiming there was nothing they could do.  At this point I sat down and  resigned myself to eating a Cold Steak Burrito.  As I was taking my second bite, visions of Chipotle's  E. coli outbreaks of 2015 appeared in my head and bested my hunger.   So I plopped the Burrito on the front counter and left.  Complain you say?  Ah yes, the ""comment & contact line"" in the ""Guac App"" is ""inhabited"" by an A.I. or robot.  The ""inhabitant"" even acknowledged it was a ""robot"".  Seizing on some keywords the AI/Robot issued an immediate credit to my Google Pay Account (actually wait 5 to 10 days).  No apology, merely a comment about ""missing the mark"".  The automatic refund facility here had me chuckling to myself about how a dishonest person might abuse the system.More,My title says it all....you can never go wrong with chipotle! It was my first time at this location and it was absolutely delicious!,This place is horrible no wonder they are bankrupt-I dont like my food slopped all over the place and they just throw it on the tray and the food is all over -they are some kind of wierd,Love Chipotle but not today. Got in line, my grandson ordered and then I requested salad bowl. I was told they were out of lettuce - are you kidding me. How does one of main items run out - poor management that does not keep...track of inventory. If you knew you were almost out there is Publix and Target in same plaza you could have gotten some. We left without food. Not stopping at this location again.More,My family and I order take from their at least twice a week. Appreciate the requirement of masks for all employees and patrons.,They are doing everything right here...
Outdoor seating with umbrellas, excellent & fast service, friendly & quick staff, and the food is even just a bit better than other Chipotle's.
A+++++  Highly Recommended!,All the good of Chipotle with speed, happy employees, great taste, good prices, and the Yum Factor!
$7 for veggie bowl.
I am vegan...good vegan options here!,I have bought salads at many Chipotles, and they are all very similar quality. In this particular store, the dining room is smaller than most, and the servers on the line are kind of robotic. I tend to buy & pay online because it's the...salad I enjoy, not the service.More,This establishment to true to the brand, but tends to run out of cooed meats and especially cooked vegetables, but when there is a line of people and the dinner hour, the volume of demand lends to the shortage. Bu the staff tries to stay...on top of it as best they can.More,There are 2 of many all time Chipotle restaurants that I speak highly of.  This one and the one on 436 near I4 in Altamonte Springs.  If I had to choose between the two it would be this Lake Mary one.

I have been to...this location on average of 2-3 times a week over a time span of 15 months.

My order of choice Dbl Steak Bowl.

I cannot speak of the beans because I usually only do that on Nachos.

The steak is in my experience always fresh but then I usually went between 1:30-6pm.

The vegetables always cut and cooked fresh.  I have NEVER had a bad experience at this location and only once over all my experiences.

The tea is literally tea brewed and yes fresh (may wanna get some ice though).  The lemons aren't sitting out for hours on end either.

Atmosphere kinda like Hollister and Abercombe type crowd.

They do serve beer, no wine.  Juice and milk at some locations as well.

Prices are fair in my opinion.  

Food is Healthy and no preservatives.

Staff are super friendly.  Seating well it's sort of fast food, but ya I usually had to go back to the office.  But I would eat there if I had the time.  

You can also order ahead of time and pick it up and skip the line.  

This location gets BUSY.  But the line moves right a long.  

The only set back is, this store is Not big enough for its location and the amount of people coming there.  Honestly if it was bigger, I think a lot more business would come.  Also the Lake Mary Blvd sign for this gold mine they have trees practically blocking the sign.  As a store owner I would want to fix it, but you can easily miss the turn if your not paying attention.

Parking is not so friendly.  You may just want to throw in the towel and park in the plaza parking and walk over.  It's that good to do the little walk.More,I've lost count of how many times I've been here. Staff are always pleasant & the food is always great.,This was one of our great Chipotle experiences. The staff is very fast and well organised so you don't have to wait.
All the food is as fresh and variegated as is known for Chipotle in general.
Yummy, yummy, yum, yum!!!  :-D,Even at peak of lunch during the week, the food was fresh, stainless prep area clean, super friendly staff and FAST team work from order through paying.   This was my first visit to this particular Chipotle and will most certainly return.   They have what it...takes to serve folks in the area on lunch hours quickly leaving time to relax a little before heading back to the office.  Way to go !!!!!More,As far as ""fast"" food goes, it's hard to beat this fresh and simple take on Mexican food.  Pick your delivery system (hard or soft tacos, Burrito, bowl, etc.) rice, beans, choice of 5 different meats.  Also sofritas.  salsas, veggies and cheese.  They also have...pretty good guac but the chips are often on the stale side.  Value is pretty good considering the quality and speed.  Kids (usually late teens and twenty somethings) behind the counter are helpful and friendly.  My son and I go there regularly.  Usually about once a week,  There is typically a line out to the door during peak times, but they go pretty fast. Small parking lot, but there are spaces in the plaza lot.More","They deliver locally with robots, and it's worth a visit to the restaurant to watch the robots come and go.",
"So delicious! The staff there was very friendly and cooperative with us. Food is well priced, huge portions and very good! Itâ__s freshly made and good quality !,This was my second experience at Hama Sushi and it was great both times! The sushi isnâ__t the best Iâ__ve ever had but itâ__s good enough and at a low price to get me to come back again! The quality plus the fun experience of...the conveyor belt ordering system is enough for me to recommend it!
Your greatest at the door by a robot hostess that gives you a wait number. We didnâ__t wait long until two seats opened for us at the bar, you can choose to sit a both but since there was only two of us we didnâ__t mind the bar. 
You order on a little screen in front of you and when your order is about two people down the screen lights up and plays a cute little song! I ordered Pork Miso Soup, Tuna Belly Nigiri x2, Salmon Nigiri, a Cali Roll and Edamame. The soup was good, the tuna was great, didnâ__t care much for the salmon, and the edamame is served cold but still good! 
As good as the sushi was my favorite part was dessert! I ordered a slice of chocolate cake which was really good! My companion ordered the Mille Crepes, and after tasting his I ordered a piece as well! Itâ__s delicious, you have to order it to end a fun night!
So after all that and a few Cokes my check was only 1700_¥ which is a steal! Next time Iâ__m in Okinawa, Iâ__m definitely coming back!More,Stopped in for a lunch during a business trip. Interesting lay out with both touch screen ordering and pick up by conveyor belt. Nice selection of items, which were perfect for lunch.  Surprisingly cheap.,Located just opposite America Village.  Not difficult to locate this shop along highway 58 with æ´_æ__ã_®é__å±± å__è°·åº_located besides it.  If you take a public transport, alight at æ¡_æ±_ Kuwae Bus Stop (near America Village).

Serve wide range of sushi. When you enter into the shop,...there is a robot.  Just choose number of pax, and whether you want a table seat or counter seat.  A ticket will be dispense from this robot.

The sushi is value-for-money.  All comes with rice and fish or ingredients. if you want other options, no worries, there is an electronic menu that comes with English.

Very popular outlet so need to go there slightly early during weekends. Their service is good and place is very clean.More,Great place to get some sushi. I like the touch screen to order what you want. The price is very cheap and the quality is decent as well. I haven't had a bad experience here yet. Highly recommend going.,Not sure what the craze is about. The sushi is good. Mediocre. Not going to blow you away. Clean. Decent.,Of the sushi-go-rounds that we have visited on Okinawa (over 8) this location was our least favorite.  It was very busy, which at least means the sushi is fresh, but the delays in getting sushi were problematic as we were seated at the last table...on the conveyor and would have to wait for longer periods for the sushi we wanted.  

Additionally, this location does not have a special order conveyor system like other places meaning that if you do place an order here, it gets placed on the sushi-go-round with all the other sushi and other patrons may snag it before it gets to your table.  

The pieces of and variety of sushi were average as were the staff.   The price was average as well; for three people we spent about $25 dollars for our meal.  

In a pinch, this place will do, but I would recommend the sushi-go-round on the other side (northbound lane) of the 58.More,This place is very good.  There is always a line to get a table. You have the choice to pick from already made sushi or you can place your own order.  Everything is done from a touch screen and is very easy to operate.,Hamazushi is where I like to go to satisfy my sushi craving when I am in a hurry or wanting to save some cash. Simple rolls and nigri pieces on a sushi go-round make this establishment a quick stop that is extremely affordable. Prices vary...between $1-3 dollars. Because it is a local favorite and close to the Air base this place fills up quickly, so the best time to go is when they just open at 11 am, or early for dinner. If you go around 7pm on a Friday or Saturday expect to wait an hour.More,Hamazushi is an inexpensive, ""fast-food"" type sushi-go-round in the heart of the Kadena-Foster area of Okinawa. Prices are great, with most sushis costing around 100 yen, or 90ish cents. Be sure to order your sushi fresh; the computer screen will display the menu in English...for you, if you just push the ""English"" button on the first page. I highly recommend the grilled spicy salmon belly!More,Classic sushi-go-round. Most dishes are two pieces of sushi on a plate for about a dollar. Classic dishes like natto, fermented soy beans, can be found here. This place is more for those who like a piece of sushi on rice vs fancy Americanized sushi...rolls. Also has things like french fries and chicken nuggets and hamburger for the kids. I'm quite partial to the eel. Ordering is done by touch screen and delivered by conveyor belt. Touch screen has options for both Japanese and English text. When finished eating just stack up the plates and they will come and tally your bill to be payed at the front.More,We really enjoyed the food here.  The price was great and they have a decent selection.  You get to choose what you want from the line or place orders.  Kids had a blast.,Great sushi! Most plates Y90 (.75) which is awesome. We ate here for lunch, 4 people, had one beer tons of sushi, and 3 deserts total cost was Y3900 ($32). Can't beat it.,If you're looking for a fast and inexpensive lunch, this is the place. I normally have 10 plates of sushi, dessert, and a drink for around 1400 yen. Ordering is easy with the tablets at your table. Make sure to get there when they open,...as this is place popular with the locals. You can get better sushi here, but if you want something quick and easy, you can't go wrong with Hamazushi.More,Sushi here is cheap and fresh. Price is reasonable and you still can order special dishes through the electronic device on your table. hot tea and cold water also available for free.", They have a robot acting as a waiter,
"There was a bit of a build up to this place. I was told the best ever Japanese restaurant but alas the chicken nan ban was cold, the ramen took 20 minutes to come out and it was lukewarm and the broth was so slightly...seasoned. It was not bad just not as good as some of the Japanese restaurant we are familiar with, in fact not even close. I tried the potato beer with was just as disappointing. Iâ__m sure this is a deliberate taste differentiation but itâ__s not to my palate as Iâ__ve read some really good reviews for this place, just not for me.More,I went downstairs to try this out for lunch. The experience got worse as it went on.  I stopped my lunch and went somewhere else after waiting endlessly to get a menu and then to be served and being barked at. 
The waitress clearly didnâ__t...want to serve me and was really peeved when I had to interrupt her personal chit chat with a colleague behind the bar after waiting 15 minutes to try and get a menu then another 15 minutes to try and order.
Plenty of other better places around here who actually like customers. Try somewhere else. None of the other places treat their customers like trashMore,We arrived quite late from our day tour today, and the weather suddenly drop so cold. So we decided to have ramen, near the place we stopped. We found this ramen shop, they famous with tsukemen (cold ramen), but we also try the miso soup...ramen and tantan ramen. Their soup based taste good, and a warm soup ramen is best for weather like this :)More,Not super happy about my experience here. I was the second customer, the place being empty, and they won't let me choose where I sit. I preferred a small table for two, but they quickly moved me to the bar. I understand that it's better...for their business but it comes at the cost for the customer. 

Speaking of which. When I got my ramen which was supposed to come with pork and bamboo shoots, it's one tiny piece of pork, two (2!) bamboo shoots, a leaf of seaweed and 95% of the remaining plate was noodles. 

The broth was alright to be fair but if I just wanted to eat noodles I would cool it at home and not go here and pay 19 AUD for it.

This is the worst ramen experience I've had so far.More,I'd have to rate this place the worst Ramen I've had - and I've had Ramen in Singapore, Tokyo and many places in Australia and USA. I had the Miso based broth which was rather thick and totally lacked flavour. My partner had the chicken...broth which was equally flavourless. The noodles were no more than okay. They seemed a bit grainy - like wholemeal noodles can be but I don't think they were wholemeal. 

When we arrived one other table was occupied and when they left we were the only customers at peak dining time of 7:30pm. Never a good sign. 

It was a very disappointing meal.More,Such good food and service was bang on! 
Only thing was there was only one veggie option on the whole menu and itâ__s a cold dish..not ideal.
But still good food.,This place is next to my work so I popped in for lunch. I've ordered the dried soba with slow cooked pork, where pork is no where to be found. Underwhelming for the price charged. And the soba wasn't the soba I'm expecting. I would...not pay $17 again for a small ramen. You would find a better ramen place around Melb CBD with a cheaper price tag.More,For a fancy looking restaurant, the ramen was too underwhelming to charge twenty dollars for, I do not recommend this restaurant if you're on a budget, but if you're looking for an atmospheric restaurant then this restaurant is for you. Now I've been exploring ramen...restaurants for a while now and I have to say this ramen wasn't up to my standards for $20 if I had to give it a price range I'd give it $13More,Great to find this gem, Ramen is a cult food, for those who know the glory of meat soups, getting that nuticious bone broth perfect with herbs and spices - is the art, these guys are in control of their territory,We had some Japas between us and Ramen for mains. Everything was delicious and the hosts were very friendly. I'll be visiting again for sure!,Very good one, the noodle is homemade, firmed and chewed texture.  The sauce served with is homemade too, definitely not the other shops putting all others sauced mixed together.  To finish the sauce, they will give you a pot of soup to dilute the sauce,...it makes you warm.More,Amazing food and great beer selection. I have not visited many ramen restaurants but this way better than I expected. The staff was friendly and while the seating was limited it was very nice. I will go back.,This is a typical small cosy restaurant - the ramen and other dishes are very tasty-they are good size so unless you are very hungry you don't need to get any side dishes.

I really liked the atmosphere in here, downstairs have tables suitable for...2 or more and upstairs more of a Ramen bar type seating.

The food here is delicious and I would recommend it.More,We love eating at this Ramen bar. Very cosy, sometimes hard to get in but the food is delicious. It's great downstairs even at the bar, great sake also.  A bit of a regular.,Been there both lunch & dinner. Both times were pretty packed. First time had the Wafu Tsukemen, which was pretty tasty. Also had the Macha Creme Brulee, it didn't wow me thought. Second time, had the Tantan Men and Tori Soba. The Tantan Men was...more spicy than we thought but it was nice. Tori Soba was pretty boring. Didn't like the chicken meatball as it had cartilage in it, some people like it, but it's not really my thing and it wasn't mentioned in the menu either. Service was so so, the lady on the ground floor was a bit blunt and short on both occasions. The guy downstairs was much more friendly and we chatted a bit. Not sure if there would be a third time though. Portion was also on the small side consider the price tag. Can't say I was full after the Tori Soba.More","The servers don?_?t really care about the guests because they are not service friendly, they work as robots.",
"Bought americano and take away. But the cover is loose... size not match... coffee spilled onto my shirt and burn my body...
Feedback to the counter... attitude damn poor and just responded complaint lah, they also fed up !!! Not even one sorry word...,The coffee is so vile, Iâ__m not sure how they manage to get that from their espresso machine. Instant coffee tastes better. Worst part is, no takeaway cups. Yep very convenient for an airport coffee shop.,We were looking for a nice coffee and a break. But 14:00 was obviously too late for the attendee who was anything but helpful. Didnâ__t have much of the items on the menu and ended up serving a lukewarm cup of water and a the...bag for rm 11. Ridiculous price and lousy service - not an ideal combination.More,How is it possible ? This like robot... No... I think a robot would say hello/thank you/goodbye at least... You know what I mean... A robot could be more human...,The attitude of the staff here is indescribable. 11am and they look like they partied all night (one of them had on a pair of shades too) and were continuing from last night with the loud and inappropriate music being played. Service was slow and...lazy. The same guy was the cashier, taking orders and making coffee and sandwiches. Another guy walked out from the kitchen and couldnâ__t be bothered to assist. Maybe 2nd guy needed to nap or his shift had yet to start. God knows! The first guy took my order and then he walked out of the stall to another outlet a few doors away to do I donâ__t know what. I waited 15 minutes for a weak Americano. This is one of the rare times I wish there was a Starbucks despite Starbucksâ__s bad coffee and offerings.More,Bad attitude barista. Playing ridiculously loud music - offensive! There may be better staff but the young man working today was a shocker.,Best place while waiting to board my flight. Tried their aglio olio pasta. Taste pretty good. Coffee also very nice,I had a chicken sandwich, which was a bread bun with chicken and cost RM22.15. When I looked inside there were two very small slivers of chicken and I could hardly taste them as the bun was so big. I felt very ripped off and...hungry - had to go and buy a sandwich from another shop .More,Best looking of airside food places. We were deceived! Took ridiculously long time, no teas or hot chocolates as 'all finished'.

Keep on walking!,This place has a captive market and don't they know it. Once through to the Departures area of Penang Airport, there isn't a whole lot of choice if you're hungry.

And so it was that I came to purchase what is possibly the poorest excuse...for a cheese sandwich (ambitiously named a Vegetarian Delight) I have ever had the misfortune to experience.

A leaf of lettuce, a slice of tomato, and a thin slice of processed cheese they had the audacity to market as Cheddar, covered in some sort of greasy, sugary sauce that I am guessing was meant to pass for mayonnaise - it didn't. 

All served by a youth who looked like he wished he could be anywhere else. I understand how he feels.

Even the coffee was average and I'm not sure how you manage that with something as simple as a long black.

Do yourself a favour and eat before you head to the airport or, failing that, eat before you go through to Departures. Even the McDonalds before Security would be heaven compared to this place.More,It's one of the 4 or 5 food outlets in the departure side. Ordered a salted caramel macchiato - it's ok, passable. 

Only 1 staff working, taking orders and making coffee, so took a while. Maybe his buddy was kidnapped 2 years ago and they...are still raising the ransom (you have to be there to appreciate the joke). 

More to pass time while waiting for tie flight.More,The only decent cafe after you pass immigration at Penang airport. Nice seating with small selection of pastry. Did not get to try the food. Great location to wait for boarding.,The outlet advertised Chicken and rice as the special of the day â_¦ but they did not have any rice.  My wife asked for mushroom soup choosing from the five types 'on offer' only to be told ""we only have pumpkin"".  We ordered coffees, sat...at a table that we found was dirty and asked for a cloth.  A smartly dress youth tore himself away from his telephone and gave the table top a perfunctory wipe sneering at me as he did so (the otherwise unemployable owner's son perhaps?) and the coffee we were served was poor.  Be warned.  There are cleaner, better staffed and better catered alternatives further down DeparturesMore,This place is great, we went here to grab lunch while waiting for a flight. We were a few ringgit short so the guy (I think he was the boss) gave us our juices for free. The chicken rice was delicious. By far the best...option for food and coffee next to the gates.More,Standard airport coffee shop. Has tables and music and fast service.

I had the surf and turf and my steak and prawns were way overcooked.

We have been there twice on a Friday night and had a delicious meal, the menu is varied and there is...something for every taste.
The venue is a bit tired, the staff are fabulous, parking is not a problem.
Kids will enjoy the area for children to play in, some indoor and some outdoor.More,Hi Tina M,

Thank you for taking the time to provide this detailed review of your experience at Jamison. I'm so pleased to see that you enjoyed your meals with us, and I will pass on your kind comments to the rest of the team....More,I used to come to this Jamison club for lunch or dinner fairly regularly.  The food was once reliably good.  Recently I have come less often as the food quality has deteriorated and now could only be said to be reliably poor.  Simple things such...as a lamb roast which was more like a mutton chop, snapper and chips where the fish was not fresh or properly cooked.  Came again today and tried the beef roast.  The beef was insipid.  Perhaps I should learn and not come again. (Service has never been its strong point).More,Hi Antbird1,

Thanks for taking the time to review our venue. Iâ__m disappointed to read the quality of meals is not what it once was. We are always looking to consistently offer meals of the best quality. I hope you were able to voice your...More,Was visiting Canberra due to bushfires in our original destination.  A catch up with family saw us dining here. Overall the venue looked clean and inviting. I ordered the chicken and cashew salad which was one of the best feeds I have had in a...long, long time. It was really fresh and tasty. No skimping on the chicken or cashews and the fresh herbs made it.  There was something for everyone- we were a diverse group and all left well satisfied. Would love the recipe!More,Hi Whosuki,

Thank you for taking the time to provide this excellent feedback on your recent visit to our venue. I will pass on your comments to our team about the Salad and we look forward to seeing you again soon.

Kind regards,

Andrew Wolthof,...More,We are members of the Canberra Southern Cross group and as we live within walking distance of this venue we go there for dinners on occasion. 

After ordering our food we purchased a drink from the bar. The beer I had didnâ__t taste correct and...others also werenâ__t impressed. 

Once the food arrived it was not hot enough and seemed to have been sitting under the heat lamps for some time. 

At best the the food quality was poor. It looked okay, but a far cry from where it was a few months ago. 

Whether the a club is cutting costs in an attempt to keep prices down or have changed chefâ__s Iâ__m not sure. 

For what we paid for our dinner Iâ__d expect a lot better as we can go to an independent restaurant and pay almost the same and get much better food and a better experience. 

We will not be hurrying back and and would prefer to pay a little more and go a bit further.More,I always love bringing my family to Southern Cross Jamison. The food is always outstanding and reasonably priced. The barramundi special was a particular standout and I could not fault it. The kids love the playground outside and the  games room inside. The kids meals...are excellent with a big selection to choose from, including all the traditional kids meals plus some really healthy options too. Fantastic service and such a relaxing atmosphere keeps us coming back again and again.More,Hi Kate W,

"Horrendous cold food that arrived late. The men in the shop next door are the rudest. Would avoid at all costs.,We went in and placed our order. The lady serving took our money. My partner had to tell her 3 times that he didnâ__t want any legs in his chicken box. We decided to wait outside whilst it was being cooked. She called me back...in to tell me that they didnâ__t have any medium pizza bases. I opted for small. A few minutes later she came back out to ask me what I wanted on my second pizza. It took 20 mins for our food to be ready. We got our food and went home. We then realised that she hadnâ__t put the chips in the bag. My partner called them, then went back to collect them. He was told that he didnâ__t order any chips. He definitely did. He then paid and waited for chips.
The turkey ham on the Hawaiian pizza wasnâ__t very nice. The chicken pieces were dry. 
Not a great experience. Probably wonâ__t bother again.More,I had the fried chicken burger. In the bun was 2 fried chicken strips with mayo and lettuce. it was really hard to eat the burger kept falling out, would have been better to be a fillet. I was glad I was eating this at...home as it was very messy. The batter on the chicken was bland and soggy so fell off the chicken. The part of the chicken was also dry.
We had Kinda bueno milkshakes, these were nice but not wort the price needed more kinder in them.More,Very disappointed with the food we received. Will definitely never be ordering from here again. Ordered chicken and shish kebabs. The meat was extremely dry with absolutely no moisture - like eating leather. The chicken was so dry it was practically inedible. My kids left...most of their food. Lamb shish was like cubes of leather caked in dry spice slathered in chilli sauce. To top it all off, it arrived more than an hour and a half late. One word sums up my experience with this place - abysmal!More,We ordered food for 2 people using the robot Starship service. I had 2 notifications that the order was delayed and after 1 hour 40 mins the robot arrived empty! What idiot sent the robot with no food in it?!??? Ridiculous!,Amazing delicious  food. Different varieties of foods which is great, friendly staff and quick service.ð___ð__¼,Ordered a platter _£28.99+_£3 delivery charge  got call from them saying they donâ__t have lamb shish they gona give chicken doner  it was rubbish and I mean rubbish donâ__t order from there WASTE OF MONEY,Spent nearly _£40 on 2 wraps and 2 chicken and rice.it was 2 hours late.rang the restaurant and kept being told it's on the way.it turns up stone cold and disgusting.it prob could have been nice if fresh.ill never be ordering from just eat again...or order from this placeMore,We ordered 3  kebab meals and the chicken and chips were very over-cooked.  
Also, we ordered a bit of sauce on our kebabs, but they were drenched.
Not impressed!,The website says they are open at 11am I tried calling from 11.20 am onward, but no answer. Collection on Just eat says it starts at 11.20 am, but thee shop is not open, so a wasted journey for me, had a call after 12...saying order ready to collect, even though when I called them whilst outside etc there was no answer. I asked that it be delivered instead as did not want to make the journey again, this was agreed but still had to pay a _£2 delivery charge this should have been free after the hassle I had.
Peri chicken was ok not the best, but the cheese bites were nice and the veg burger and jacket potato and I really enjoyed the biriyani great portion size.
I think customer serivice needs to be reviewed. Would not order through just eat for this place againMore,Absolutely shocking service waited over a hour for food to be delivered even though the website said 35 mins delivery for the food to arrive like it had just come from a fridge! Been trying to ring the place for over 20 mins now to...ask for a refund and then to collect the food but they are not answering their phone!More,We have ordered from here many times as the food is really good once we have received it however if you are hungry I wouldnâ__t advise ordering from them as you can wait up to 2 hours for delivery, they donâ__t contact you if something...is unavailable either which is a let down. If you want good food make sure you order way in advance of your eating time.More,Wow and not in a good way Morrisco used the old chat up line under new management a few months back so I thought let's see if there any better now, so I had the order in my Just Eat basket but I hate spending...50p when I own a phone so I phoned these lot up. The basket total was _£29.95 which included the delivery charge of a whole _£2.50 and the 50p booking fee. But over the phone the price instead of at least being 50p cheaper was actually dearer at _£31.45. So I said to the guy how can you be more expensive over the phone than through Just Eat, and the guy is telling me that the price is the same so I said if that was true than I wouldn't be saying your ripping customers off. He then wanted me to tell him what his own prices are on Just Eat so I said if I tell you your business than what's in it for me, and he said I could use Just Eat if I want it cheaper. You can guess where I told the guy to go and warned him about my upcoming review and he said that he didn't care. My guess is Iv'e escaped wasting over _£30 on food, and thankyou mum for those extra maths classes.More,Veggie burgers are very nice and filled with flavour. Snickers milkshake was so tasty omgggg. Cheese was actually melted on chips for once. Delivery driver was super nice.,Dropped in tonight on my way home for a perri perri chicken meal, chicken was well cooked and succulent with just the right amount of spice, fries are crispy I really enjoyed it definitely going back for more.
Well worth a visit if you are...starving !More","Delivered by a robot which was interesting. Just a fascinating fact about this place, sometimes they serve tables with their orders through a robot.",
"The atmosphere is pretty spectacular. What would have been a neutral industrial space is brought to life with houseplants, interesting lighting and great natural light. The cappuccino was perfect and the cake I ordered was light and lemony.

Wonderful spot to stop by for a...few hours and work.More,We had super nice brunch there:) I got the yogurt and my boyfriend got to try two different roasts that were delicious. I like the most the service because everybody is smiling and definitely give you positive vibes. Thanks!,Found this place by mistake.  Really lovely staff and delicious coffees.  Delicious granola and good croissants.  Rest of the food looked good too.  Would definitely revisit.",Easiest place to park is in the robot lot behind the city hall across the street.,
"Best Japanese food in Valencia. I have been in Valencia 5 months and Iâ__ve had crensa maybe 25 times. I highly recommend it, it is the first place I think to order when I want to go out for food!,I was shouting at by the staff in front of all the guests and then followed.. and only because I said that 2 different drinks tasted the same and were priced differently. Strongly advise to stay away as far as possible.,Greetings Trendsetters,

Today the sun was splitting rocks with the temperatures soaring to 30+ degrees celcius.
With the weather so sublime in sunny Valencia I went for a two hour jog.
Hunger struck.
I found myself in a neighbourhood right in the city centre beside...the Turia Park.
 For 30 minutes I scoured the mean streets for some healthy, tasty and economical food.
Alas - I was surrounded by  kebab shops flogging their unhealthy food substitutes for 6 euro per kebab and 3 euro for a sugar laden coke.
Then over the horizon I spotted hope.
That hope was the Crensa Orential Experience.
It was an Oasis of Asian Gastronomical Delights   surrounded by a barren  Desert of Dubious Duds.
The staff were friendly and speak excellant English, Spanish and a host of Asian Languages.
I ordered the PadThai Con Ternera and before you could say 'Jamie Oliver is a Tit' the friendly staff whisked me out a culinary feast.
It cost roughly 5 euro so it was much cheaper than a kebab.
It consisted of eggs, Pak Choi, Cebolla,Chives, Brotes de soja, Tofu Frito, Cacahuetes, Lima and Ternera.
The menu is professionally designed with mouthwatering pictures of each delicious dish available so you can see the culinary adventure that lays ahead of you -should you venture this way by chance.
The menu also has  pictorial symbols so you can visually see what ingredients your potential feast will include - different symbols inform you for example if your potential dish has lactose or eggs or soya so if you do not want to get these in the dish you order you can order a dish with out the lactose or eggs or soya for example.
As I mentioned a little earlier you could have gone to a kebab restaurant and paid 3 euro for a coke. In Crensa they have Thailand Juice made up of Mango and Taramind and Lichi for 2 euro. Sure you could pay 3 euro for a sugar laden coke and have a heart attack half way through your meal or you could pay 2 euro and have a  healthy delicious mango Taramind and Lemon flavoured nectar - the choice is yours I guess.
I chose Crensa.
You know it makes sense!
- If you do decide to venture this way off the beaten path on a culinary adventure of delight please please please mention to the staff that you read Jr's TripAdvisor Review and wanted to check out the Asian Cuisine for yourself.
Adios amigos y amigas.
ROCK ON.More"," No, any robot would be more humane and emotional than her, we thought.",
"This was my first visit to Kinkaku and hopefully won't be my last.  This is likely the best japanese cuisine in the region.   With dishes and variations likely not served elsewhere perhaps.  

This was my first time having Takoyaki (octopus balls) and Okonomyaki (a type...of pancake) and both were AMAZING.  The sushi and shashimi was excellent, the fried dumplings so-so.  Service was friendly but chaotic.  They forgot a dish or two and my beer LOL.  

The price is fairly hefty though.  $37.99 for dinner pp, plus a 15% service charge which does not include the tip.  I didn't like the automatic service charge, hence the 4 star rating would have been 4.5.More,Downtown Kitchener is this wonderful all you can eat in 1.5 hours for one price.  You can order as many items off the menu as you want and continue to order during your allotted time.  There is a wide variety to choose from - sushi,...sashimi, beef, pork, chicken, seafood, rice dishes, etc.  My favourite is the beef teriyaki on skewers cooked to perfection.  It is a great place to try things that you may normally not eat, such as eel.  The service is efficient and friendly.  The portions are small but you will leave full and satisfied.More,Not at all my kinda place. If you like large volumes of cheap food youâ__ll enjoy - itâ__s all you can eat. For me I couldnâ__t wait to leave.,The food here is always amazing and i cannot complain about that whatsoever. But the service by the hostess over the phone definitely needs some work. I called in to question about my Ubereats order and her tone was condescending. She spoke to me rudely...and when I got rude back she asked â__Are you having a bad day???â__ in some toddler voice....then when i asked to speak to a manager she hung up the phone ..... I donâ__t think thatâ__s the way you should be treating the customer, even if they were having a bad day

However once i called back the manager who spoke to me was very polite and explained the mistake that I made when placing my order I really appreciated.More,Instagram ID: anjav3

Food/Drinks: 
- Desserts to try are Deep Fried Mars Bars (for chocolate loves) as well as their Coconut ice cream which isnâ__t always available but itâ__s so delicious!
- For appetizers you canâ__t go wrong with Shrimp tempura. Itâ__s always served piping...hot and fresh
- Izakaya roll is the best roll they have on their menu, it definitely it a must try! We order that every single time. Even though it has eel and tuna in it, it doesnâ__t taste or smell fishy at all. Itâ__s packed with so many flavors and the tempura shrimp adds the perfect amount of crunchy-ness
- The Deep fried scallops are done perfectly. Never under or over cooked, always a pleasure to start the meal with
- Beef teriyaki as you can see in the video is always served hot and fresh. The teriyaki flavor is the perfect consistency so it sticks to the meat and isnâ__t runny

Other Comments:
- The ambiance of the restaurant suits the food that is being served as well at the culture that the food derives from
- Seating is a bit cramped but despite that I still find it intimate enough when eating with your partner or friend
- The restaurant is always clean and the service is always friendly
- I love the personal touch of being greeted when we are being shown to our table, it makes us feel welcomed 
- Overall our favourite local sushi restaurant. The best quality of food in all of Kitchener-Waterloo

Instagram ID: anjav3More,The best Sushi Iâ__ve ever had. Tastes authentic, not the overly breaded serving one usually gets to fill you up.  Selection is so different and varied,  Go if you can.,We order the dinner menu in order to have only sashimi (not rice-laden sushi pieces). It is excellent and varied, the servers are pleasant and helpful.,place is small, hence the wait time to get seated...
but the food...... i cannot even describe how good the food is..,It 's been a while I've been looking for a all you can eat whose chef is Japanese. 
We can tell the difference and at Kinkaku I felt as if I were in Japan.
The food is delicious, well prepared. I loved it,Our experience there was terrible. we had reservations for 5:30, two of us were seated and the others still parking the cars, the waitress told us we had to order right away, we had a time limit and the time starts at 5:30 sharp!! They...continued to rush us through our ""all you can eat meal"" giving us barely enough time to eat anything. The restaurant was very loud and we couldn't even hear each other at our crowded little table. The food is very good, which is the ONLY reason got 1 !! Not worth going back!More,I'd like to think of myself as a very polite and understanding person, but tonight's events have inspired me to voice some thoughts. First of all, this restaurant has incredible food without a doubt. Their service however, has always been questionable and tonight--on a huge...celebration night--we were reminded to eat within a certain time frame countless times, given a hard time about being 5 mins late for our reservation (parking in downtown Kitchener during construction season is not easy), and told to look at the menu more clearly (when I had assumed they had a dynamite roll), and they automatically added a tip into their bill. To my group, this was not hospitable or respectful treatment of paying customers. I am a huge sushi fan and was really excited to celebrate at this hotspot. This money-first, customer-second demeanour put a bad taste in all our mouths.  

Please pardon the rant, but if you are looking for a calm and relaxing dining experience, this is not the place for you. I am very disappointed in the service I experienced tonight.More,Went to Toronto for a short vacation and yelp suggested me to try. After reading some great reviews about Kinkaku Izakaya, I decided to give it a try.

The owner must of read my mind, there were lots of dishes that I loved and a...few specially rolls that I wanted to try.

All the fish tasted fresh and delicious. Absolutely love the grilled pork cheeks with the sauce. The Izakaya Roll was great as well.

If your in the area, I highly recommend this restaurant. Staff was great, welcoming and provided great service.More,Wow!! 
I had heard kinkaku was the best sushi in Kw and theyâ__re right.. or at least of what I have tried so far! I was very impressed a lot with their fried dishes as well-very clean oil, you have to try the fried chicken!...Only complaint was we were a group of 8 and it was very tight in the booth and they take orders like a regular restaurant which is hard to do with a large group for all you can eat. 
I will bring my husband here sometime, heâ__s not a fan of sushi but they have so many other good things, including a deep fried mars bar I know he would love haha!!More,I have had sushi in Japan, Vancouver, San Francisco, LA and arguably any other top rated sushi city. While not a broad selection, Kinkaku's quality of fish is top 1%. And the crazy part is that it's all you can eat! I now come once...a month! The wait is always brutal, maybe an hour or so, but it's worth the value you get. Their hot plates are also phenomenal. It's the best restaurant in KW, hands down.More,I am told it is often lined up, we went on a Tuesday at 1130, no lineup not that busy but it was in May. Food was good, wait staff attentive, they do actually limit your time which I understand why but just be prepared.", There is even a little robot that serves your meals which the kids loved.,

Restaurant Manager - LiLi,I have a hard time understanding the negative reviews I see here and am glad i took the chance anyway. I have eaten my way around the world including other hotels which randomly have exorbitant Chinese restaurants such as the Mayfair.  We started at the...ground floor bar, great experience, and then to LiLi and every step of the way was top notch service- even when i can tell some people were very new and it is hard to hire post/mid pandemic.  LiLi is beautiful and the service is for the most part several star Michelin level.  Every detail of decor is worthy of admiration- after all, this is an experience elsewise why are you at the Peninsula paris ??? The food was fantastic , donâ__t come if you are going to complain that your 100$ dinner is costing 500$ but you will not be sad if you are not counting. We ate very simply- the shu mai were so great, like any top notch or totally legit Chinese place, the sweet potato stir fry- SO GOOD, the lotus root stir fry SO GOOD and the tuna seared app.  Oh the cocktails though too.  If you want more potatoes, baguettes , overcooked steak - skip this- but if you want a rare opportunity such as one can only find at this Peninsula or Mayfair londonâ_¦do not hesitate!  Serious questions though as for why some female staff wore cheongsam with a Japanese style sash â_¦and the men a suit type thing with a similar sash that look cossack. Tres bizarre.  Otherwise the decor was so great.More,Dear Sir,

Restaurant Manager - LiLi,We arrived a little bit before 18:30 as booked, but the door was closed, they opened at 18:32, ridiculous for this type of restaurant to wait outside. The receptionist didn't say a word she was like a robot, like a cute robot. we got a...table close to the bar where the bar tender started to make noise with its drink mixer, like a robot. We had a nice Chinese music but soon a DJ arrived and we got some kind of hip hop music, strange for this place. Then the worst arrived, we ordered dim sums at EUR28 for 3 of them, and we got fish soup, boeuf bourguignon and some thing else type of dim sums, They explained to us that this was a fusion restaurant with a 2 Michelin stars Chef. The Peking Duck was too dry, and the dessert ordinary pieces of Mango in a sugary juice.
We worked 10 years in China and we went to hundred of Chinese restaurants in the world. Not impressed by this one to say the least. 
Very expensive for what it is.More,Dear Sir, Dear Madam,

The service was slow, not very attentive, the food was rather mediocre in regards of the dim sum (selection, presentation and quality), the soups are over spiced. I had to send back my main...course: I specifically asked for white meat chicken with cashew nuts. I got the chicken with skin and some articulation rests from poor deboning. 
The price is just exorbitantly high for what you get. And if you walk by the hotel shopping arcade, all shops went out of business, the toilets are dirty and the baskets full with dirty towels. 
Overall a very poor experience. And this is mostly sad, because you can see there is lots of staff working there, but no one seems to manage them and the building is beautiful. Itâ__s really a putty!More,We went there for dinner for my wifeâ__s birthday. We both had the 8-course set menu. I had booked through the restaurantâ__s website and noted it was my wifeâ__s birthday.

We enjoyed the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant very much. We had reservations for...9 pm and it was quite lively.

The first four courses were all delicious and perfect. Then something happened. A beef course was served immediately after the first Peking Duck. It was very heavy and served literally one minute after the Peking Duck had been cleared. We were then served noodles. The second Peking Duck serving was essentially a â__mini taco.â__  It could hardly be described as worthy of being called a separate course and was indeed served alongside the noodles.  This is not how the eight course menu is described on their website.

The timing of the various servings was appropriate for the first half and was then hurried.  There were some other flaws.  Our hot towels were not removed from the table until well into our meal. Wine service was fine but they had a difficult time keeping up with serving sparkling water.  

And there was no recognition of my wifeâ__s birthday.  Not a big deal but I had seen they had done something on other reviews.

We had a nice evening there but it was not perfect by any means. The second half of the set menu was odd and it appeared at times that the serving staff was simply overwhelmed. The decor and atmosphere was five star, however.More,I mean we had a set menu because we were a large group and the food was AMAZING!! The lady who hosted our table was so lovely and professional. Hats off to the chef the manager and the staff. The hotel that itâ__s located in...is phenomenal. Great great placeMore,Have been there twice, first times la carte and inside, enjoyed it. Second time sited outside, had the chefs' degustation menu and it was average (food, service, all). 
Will not go back...,Being a regular client of the hotel i decided to try the restaurant not staying there this time. Disappointing that stuff is still expecting you to dress in shirts and pants for dinner even with the heat of 35 degree and otherwise treat you in...a funny way. We still got a table and service was good and food was interesting and all dishes were tasty. After the dinner i wanted to have drink at the bar on the roof as i usually do but i was told â__you should wear appropriate clothes â__ if translated from french. Is probable because i had t shirt on. C mon, its the 35 degree and i want to feel comfortable spending my evening not to dress for the drink or two. Bar is relax place, not a high end restaurant.More,Dear Sir,

Thank you for taking the time to write this review.

I am really sorry to read your experience did not meet your expectations. I took all your comments into consideration to make sure such a situation does not happen in the future.

The food is delicious, with some classic Cantonese dishes on the menu. Particularly loved the crispy tofu sheet rolls with vegetables!
The d_©cor is...a little off-putting, in my personal opinion. It is poorly lit and the music was too loud for my liking. Giant red curtains hang, giving off a red hue on my Mum's face throughout dinner! Despite that, the nice little touch of a red bean birthday bun for my mum was lovely. Many thanks to the team for a sweet gesture!More,Dear Madam, Dear Sir,

I am really sorry to read the decor did not meet your expectations, but I am truly...More,We recently dined at Lili, while staying at the Peninsula Hotel. The room glamorous, set in brilliant colors, gauzy curtains and luxurious finishes. We ate in the early evening, and the restaurant was not terribly busy at that point.
The staff was exceedingly helpful and...attentive. The menu offers a large number of al la carte items, as well as a pre fixe menu. The pre fixe looked like too much food for our taste (8 courses, I believe), so we opted for selected items. 
This restaurant is known for its Peking duck, so we knew we wanted to try that. Our waitress helpfully volunteered that the dish was good to share, since it amounted to an entire duck. I had the wonton soup to start, which was some of the best wonton I have ever enjoyed. My wife had what amounted to spring rolls, which were good but a little on the greasy side.  Then the duck arrived. It was presented to us by the ""duck"" server, who explained how it would be cut and served. It was beautiful, but more importantly, delicious! We were provided with very thin pancake -like tortillas, with cut scallions, celery, pepper and the like, to accompany the duck in the pancake. The skin was incredibly crispy and the meat juicy. The portion of the duck that is not served as part of the ""Peking"" preparation is then prepared separately - we chose the sweet and sour option. It was very good, and we accompanied it with a beef fried rice that I liked very much, but my wife found off-tasting. Very expensive.More,Dear Sir, 
Thank you so much for taking the time to review your dining experience at LiLi restaurant.
I am glad to read you enjoyed our dramatic decor as well as our authentic cantonese cuisine and specially the Pekin Duck. I look forward to welcoming...More",None,
"A cool place that combine grocery shopping with dining options and chill-out corners. The grocery areas are spacious and clean, quite different from your usual grocery shop. You can even send out your purchase on packing belt for it to be packed and ready when...you want to leave. After finish our grocery shopping, we headed to the dining area to chill. I chose the corner area (under the fake blossom tree) where you sit on the floor (on cushions/ floor chairs). There were many family with kids there so they can hang out and make friend with each other while parents chit chat. We got the popular fish and chip to try, it was good though the fried was a tad dry that day. A nice place to chill after the chore of grocery shopping, though the food and drinks are on the high side.More,Good service 
Great App (cashless transcation)
Fantastic deal & good food served 
Clean and cosy environment,Nice decoration and ambience. Wide variety of food/drink selection! Food is a little bit pricey but portion is reasonable! Will come back again!,Wife read about the place and we decided to drop by to check it out. Firstly you will have to download the honestbee app and register before trying to even get through the gantry. Everything on the shelf can be scan and pay so that...you can walk out with the food directly or put into the trolly for the auto-check out. There is an interesting alcohol section and the whiskey collection as well as craft beer is worth taking a look. Further in is a cocktail and liquor bar with a cozy room to chill out. 

The food selection is worth mentioning, go for the char siew noodle the meat is really good almost Kl Overseas Restaurant standard. Fish and chips is great but not cheap. Best value for money is Ayam Penyat set at $6.80. 

Cool concepts being deployed here such as automated checkout and packing, and the autonomous shelving unit will bring your packed bags when u wait at the pick up area

One comment is that the app can at times be slow after you scan each item or other food. My app hung once and I had to quit and reboot the app to get back into the order. 

Overall an interesting concept and I hope that they succeed with their operations.More,What an experience !
Itâ__s a groceries plus lunch place
First time for my family 
To begin with you need to download the Apps onto your phone because the place admits you through Apps 
Then you donâ__t order from the counter and by the way...there were lots of food choices, chinese, Japanese, local, western... 
you order through the Apps 
And you pay through the Apps
When your food is ready, you are inform
.... through the Apps
You have to go collect your food 
So for those who preferred to be serve this is not the place but just go for the experience
There are fresh food on sale and I was most interested in the Fresh seafood and Oysters... huge. 
Can get them cooked on the spot too. 
A new experience for my family! Interesting!More,So everything in this place you need to utilise their application to enter, buy, shop and even eat (except for toilet). Would recommend you link your credit card to the app in advance to avoid any sort of delay.

Limited food selected, but we had...fun choosing our own seafood before bringing it to their restaurant for cooking. There will an additional SGD8 cooking charge for each item. Overall it's fun but the food wasn't fantastic.

Promotion on oyster when we visited, extremely fresh and affordable pricing.More,We patronised the place for a birthday celebration. The food and ambience was more than satisfactory. Not every staff was friendly. Most were. But 15 minutes before closing the announcement came on at maximum volume. Even the deaf could hear and the dead would rise....Thanks for a memorable evening.More,Came for dinner as a change from an ordinary restaurant and we loved it ! Great supermarket to buy unusual things -a big bottle of Fentimans dandelion and burdock pop for less than S$5 ( we live only 20 miles from where itâ__s made in...the UK ) and PG Tips ! 
Cafe on site was fab and I had the best fish and chips ever ! Great service although the use of only a mobile phone and no cash is unusual for us. Download the app and away to go.More,You will be required to download the Honest Bee App to gain entry and provide details of your credit /debit card on the App to make purchases. There is no cash payment available for any of the products sold on site. It is an interesting...open layout. You make your food orders and payment on the App then you collect your food from the Collection Point. We had Fish and Chips which was tasty but surprisingly it was not hot enough. The meal was served in a cardboard box with plastic cutlery. This was quite unexpected. I thought my order was mistaken as a takeaway! The cutlery broke as soon as we started to use them as they were very weak (cheap).Should we be using plastics?? We asked for proper cutlery and thankfully they had them. Friendly and helpful staff and once you get over the fussiness of ordering and paying on the App, you might enjoy the change of scenery. Value: It is quite pricey for what's on offer. This one visit for me is sufficient to satisfy my curiosity.More,First time I am there. Can be quite lost if this is the first time there. Am thankful to meet Lily, a staff there. She was about to eat her dinner, but she put down her food and bring us around. My friend thought she...is the boss, I told them I think she has ownership of the job.  You need to download the app before entering, this is a smart supermarket. The food is reasonable priced. The dessert is hidden in the corner... but it is a must try. I sure will come back with more friends. Make your booking and bring your date here on Thursday night .More,Came here for lunch on a weekday before the lunch crowd hit. Just as well coz the app gave so many problems it took me 20mins just to settle it. 

Ordered the halibut fish and chips with extra order of calamari. Fish was huge and...batter was well done; chips were passable, the thinner ones were crispy, the thicker ones not so. Would not order the calamari again. Even though the batter was crisp, it was smothered in spices which masked the taste of the squid. Might as well have just been eating fried batter.
For dessert, had the Poofy pancakes, which were excellent. Huge portion, light & airy, and not too sweet. Great for sharing. The HongKong egglets were not too bad. 

Problematic areas:
1. App needs working on, as mentioned above.

2. Layout of place not user-friendly. No clear signs of where certain stalls and pickup points were. 

3. Prices for the food are NOT cheap. So the least they could do was provide  proper cutlery, not flimsy plastic ones which snap while eating fish and chips and pancakes. And unless I'm ordering takeaway, I'd rather not eat my fish and chips out of a box.

4. Sent in an order for egglets, waited 15min for stall to accept the order. Had to go right to the stall to tell the guy to accept the order and prepare my food (no, there were no other customers at the time )

5. Supermarket items - nothing worth buying. Too little variety.More,Came here to try out the cafes and food after reading about it. The place is supposed to be advanced in use of technology but the customer experience is found wanting. 

Firstly you need to download the app to be able to enter. The WiFi...given for downloading is slow. 

Secondly the app to order isnâ__t very intuitive to locate the eating in option. Also like another reviewer mentioned you have to order and pay separately which is a pain when you have several items. 
The fact that you have to ask for assistance proves it is client centric, seamless and meets the ease of use for customers. Also the plastic cutlery is a joke. The teeny fork for cakes and the flimsy knife for fish & chips which as expected broke is ridiculous. 

Lastly the grocery shopping bit is just rather navigating through a maze with the items arranged around the food stalls. The automated payment and packing process was just ok. Again you need to have staff stationed there to help customers with the process which means the automated systems doesnâ__t quite address what it hopes to achieve. 

We wonâ__t be visiting again, plus the carpark charges are high for an industrial area. $5 for over an hour of parking.More,Wide variety of options to choose from.
Foods serve has a really big portion. I ordered fish and chips, and the dory was really big enough for me to share with my friends,The management really needs to look into its customer experience journey for their app and their in-store layout design.  The concept is good but the execution could definitely be improved.  Make the experience simple and seamless.

Some suggestions:
1. The app to order food for...eat-in should allow orders from various stalls at one go.  For a family meal, we may like to orders from multiple stalls.  Don't make us order, pay and choose again.  
2. The link to eat-in @ Habitat looks like a advertisement banner which is easily missed.
3. For the price we are paying, we expect proper cutleries and not plastic ones.  My fork broke while trying to eat my fish & chips.  My family was wondering if we ordered steak, how would we get thru that?
4. The app to shop for groceries is even more clunkier.  I tried to shop while waiting for my food and my cart got cleared out many times before I even finish shopping.  Was quite disappointed.
5. After dinner, we tried the good old way of groceries shopping and the nightmare start when we want to check out.  There wasn't a large table for us to scan our picks and the app limits us to 10 items so I have to pay first and start the process again for the rest of the items.

The whole customer experience is really poor and reflects very poorly on the management and Singapore.More,New concept of cashless shopping. A good range of dining choices available at a spacious cosy place. Tried the fluffy pancakes at Poofy and the fish n chips at Captain Snapper.Delicious and food portion is big enough for sharing.","a robot for delivery to its customers. Seven minutes later Walla, a talking robot arrives with your food.",
"Iâ__ve been three times to this restaurant since February. Pizza base is dry and biscuit like. There is no yeast in the base and it tastes like a pre made supermarket base. I ordered a panini the first time ( which Iâ__ve also had  at...Castle Hill) which was ok, but th3 pizzas are very disappointing. The last two visits, weâ__ve had to return the pizza as it was not hot, base wasnâ__t cold and the seafood was not cooked enough. The octopus was chewy, cold and tasted like it was undercooked. I didnâ__t get a pizza to have sashimi as a topping.
Iâ__ve gone three times, to allow for a one off bad experience, but three times show that is the standard. There are many better ones around Iâ__m sure.More,Arrived at 6pm for an early dinner. Dining alone. Waited at the door to be seated. The male waiter greeted me, looked around the restaurant, and said, ""You can take that table over there in the naughty corner."" I was handed a menu, pointed in...the direction of the table, and palmed off.

The table was located in the corner, with two chairs facing the corner wall, literally in the busy bar preparation area. The table was dirty, not wiped, and not set up, unlike all other tables which were professionally presented. 

I waited for five minutes while seated at the table and received no service. Yes, the restaurant and staff were getting busy, but the venue was not full. 

After five minutes I got up and walked out. If I wanted a table and service like this, I would have gone to the mall foodcourt. As I walked out, the bar staff appeared awkward as they watched me leave. 

I would suggest management improve the initial welcome by staff, the quality of seating. and attentiveness.

I won't be back nor will I recommend.More,I used to go regularly and always ordered the Casanlanca- loved it...I didnâ__t go for well over a year ... then ordered my old faithful - oh dear ! It has gone downhill- no more fresh prawns- it has those yucky frozen imported ones eeeeewwww...not noice at allð__©More,Last Sat night I ordered the Mykonos vegetarian pizza. It was pathetic. A undercooked doughy base, around 7 tiny cubes of feta and a few tiny scattered super thin pieces of eggplant. The eggplant was not marinated or roasted beforehand. Never again.,We will never order from GPK again. what a disappointing and totally avoidable experience from what can apparently be great pizzas:

ordered two pizzas. no chicken AT ALL on the New Orleans chicken pizza. only 4 strips of meat in total on the Morroccan pizza....there was no attempt at putting equal ingredients on each slice. 30% of each pizza had NO ingredient whatsoever on it - just bare sauce on the base. the amount of each other listed ingredient would fit in a teaspoon. there was no fetta at all.

Our hosts were apologetic and at a loss for the lack of quality and such low standard. they had raved to us about GPK. we laughed it off. it wasnt their fault.

QUALITY CONTROL was desperately lacking. the only place pizzas like this should go is in the bin.
whether it was new inexperienced staff or rush jobs because they were so busy or lack of enough staff to make them and so 45mins late of the pickup time doesnt matter..
This was NOT a 'Gourmet' experience and left a bad taste in our mouths. an offer of another pizza is not acceptable after a review like this. Only a full refund would demonstrate a genuine sign of goodwill. over to you GPK .  .  . what do you think?More,Having been a very regular customer over many years, it is sad that the quality of the pizzas has deteriorated badly recently. Dough which is uncooked,toppings which lack flavour and substance and pizzas which are almost cold. This was not the case in previous years....I loved GPK pizzas and looked forward to going there. The service is always good but there is a problem with the chefs cooking the pizzas. A real shame.More,We love GPK concept, pizzas are having good variety of toppings. I chose GF Baghdad and 
an excellent Pinot Gris, happy customer.,I really love the pizza at GPK, the Cuban is my favourite! Family friendly, great location and wonderful service.,So after three months of not going out for dinner we are all hankering for fresh pepperoni pizza. We lob up to GPK Erina. After ordering we get SALAMI pizza! Yup Salami. So I quiz the manager and he says ""its been that way for...many years. we phased out pepperoni as it was too hot for the kids"". Uhuh. So I say, ""why state pepperoni on the menu then""  ""oh we've been doing git that way for years"" was the answer. 

GPK that sucks! How about stating on the menu its Salami and giving the option to order Pepperoni? Or would that make a little too much sense in the ""give the customer what they order"" department.

Very annoyed.More,Weâ__ve been here several times over the years but each time we are more disappointed. The staff are great but the value for money is just not there anymore. I understand the pressures on the bottom line but despite the quality we thought it over...priced and the menu hasnâ__t changed in ages. Great for a quick feed after the movies but wouldnâ__t recommend for family outing despite the great layout and decor.More,We go here a lot as we use the buy one get one free vouchers.  Without these we probably wouldn't bother.  We've had good and bad meals and experiences here but we keep going as the pizza is tasty.  Service is very slow but the...owner is lovely and friendly.  Food is good and they now have a dairy free pizza option, which is great for me.  They also let you change a topping or two with no fuss.  Nice outside area.More,Waitress refused to set up an outside table for 7 as said too many large tables outside-when we suggested that we break up and sit at two smaller adjoining tables were subjected to much anger and then a great hissy fit as out of the...blue a large table was set up.Pizzas were terrible-2 were cold with limited ingredients and the 3 one came 5 minutes after the others.
We all have been regulars here for many years and put up with the always long food wait but not anymoreMore,The food is okay but nothing special.  The service was the worst I had ever had.
When placing my order the one wait person snapped at me and made me feel uncomfortable.  I commented to my companion ""how rude"".  The food came out in a...timely manner.  We had been given a glass of water each which hadnt lasted  long.  
We tried for 10 minutes to get the wait persons attention cos we needed more water.  Each time he walked passed us my companion and I both said ""excuse me"" but he kept ignoring us.  Finally, I called to him ""could we please have some more water"".  He chastized me, telling me not to yell at him across the restaurant and threatened to throw us out before we had finished our meals.  As we left my companion commented to him ""you should not be rude to your customers, we just needed water and you kept ignoring us"". ""Children come first"" he said.  There were only 5 tables occupied and no children in the restaurant at the time.  We will not go back there.More,Have tolerated this place for years however no more, it is seriously understaffed every time and incredibly slow for what is a simple meal..... pizza 
Drinks are the easiest way to make money for a restaurant however why is it so hard to watch out...for a table that is empty??? We waited 30 mins to re order the watched our drinks sit on the bar for another 15 mins going flat! About the 3rd time this has happened! 
We were served a â__complimentaryâ__ garlic pizza 15 mins in after our order was placed where alarm bells rang. Pizza took at total of 55 mins from order and the place was less than 1/10 full?? WTF?? The limited staff including manager were busy, however no organisation simply kaos running around being reactive not pro active. 
We were literally seconds away from walking out extremely frustrated when 2 simple pizzas arrived, very underwhelmed, had to search for chicken that was supposed to be included.  Cost was ridiculous for service and quality!! Cmon guys you have been in this centre for years and have never stepped up. Best advice go to dominoes pizza and sit at the beach and eat,,, Quarter of the price, extremely fast service (under 10 mins if you pick up) and far better quality....... An I never ever thought I would write a review saying that!! Go figure.. 
Cheers... a local who has had enough!More,Fab family choice.

Pleasant. Comfortable. Very friendly service, service both personal and attentive. Wide and far reaching menu. Serving sizes on the large side. All major pluses. 

Flavour a little bit bland and starter options light on beyond twists. 

Drinks very reasonably priced - would...go back !More",The biggest disappointment was they were using the robot waiter to serve meals and drinks.,
